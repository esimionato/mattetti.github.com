![BarCamp](http://www.barcampsd.org/badges_for_bcsd3/orange.png)





Just a reminder, this coming week end, San Diego presents [BarCamp](http://www.barcampsd.org/) for the third time.





This time, the chosen Venue is [Microsoft](http://www.technicaltrainingresources.com/) in [La Jolla](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&f=d&daddr=9255+Towne+Centre+Dr+San+Diego,+CA+92121)





I was thinking about preparing 2 intro talks, one on [Merb](http://merbivore.com) and one on [Unobtrusive Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript) (jQuery, Prototype + LowPro etc...), then we'll see the crowd and what people are interested in. Feel free to give me your feedback, suggestions...





I also heard that on top of the awesome people from san Diego, some other important people are coming just for the event:







  * [Kevin Clark](http://glu.ttono.us/) from the [Powerset](http://www.powerset.com/) hall of fame.


  * [Derek Neighbors](http://derekneighbors.com/) representing Phoenix's top Rails shop: [Integrum](http://integrumtech.com)





## Warning





Based on previous BarCamps, you might end up seeing [a guy wearing a kilt who talks about how he is his own imaginary friend](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/1993483057/sizes/m/in/pool-393912@N21/), having to look at  [ActionScript code](http://www.flickr.com/photos/techslut/2043825771/sizes/l/in/pool-393912@N21/), meet [a lot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/acphonehome/532658193/in/pool-barcampsd/) of [interesting people](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/531272887/in/pool-barcampsd) and even maybe learn about [lock picking](http://www.flickr.com/photos/techslut/545216043/in/pool-barcampsd).

I even heard rumors saying that [Ryan Felton](http://blog.aisleten.com/) is organizing another [wii tournament](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/1994487718/in/pool-barcampsd).
