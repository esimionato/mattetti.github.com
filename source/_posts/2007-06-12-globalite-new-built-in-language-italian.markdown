[Globalite](http://code.google.com/p/globalite/) now has built-in support for the following languages:







  * English (UK)


  * English (US)


  * French (France)


  * Spanish (Generic)


  * Italian 





I'm planning on adding support for more languages, but if you want to help me, please [email](mailto:mattaimonetti@gmail.com) me your language yaml file. Don't forget to mention the full locale (language + country) of the translation.





Database content is coming soon... as soon  as I can find some time to hack on this project.





Just a reminder:




    
    <code>script/plugin install http://globalite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
    </code>





and rename the trunk folder globalite





or svn checkout in the plugin folder:




    
    <code>svn checkout http://globalite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ globalite
    </code>
