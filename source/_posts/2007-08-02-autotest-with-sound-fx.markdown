In case you missed the latest great extension for [Zentest Autotest](http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest), here is [the blog post](http://fozworks.com/2007/7/28/autotest-sound-effects) you have to read.





Jeremy from Switzerland came up with this great idea of adding audio report to Autotest. I've been using [Growl](http://railstips.org/2007/7/23/autotest-growl-pass-fail-notifications) to notify me when my tests would pass or fail, but I simply love just hearing a different sound based on the result of the tests.

p.s: I'm working on redesigning this blog, I don't have much time and I hate IE :) I hope to get things fixed soon.
