My [recent and certainly provocative post](http://railsontherun.com/2008/3/17/rails-the-duplo-generation) generated a lot of noise. Just by reading some of the [comments](http://railsontherun.com/2008/3/17/rails-the-duplo-generation#comments) on my blog or on [reddit](http://reddit.com/r/ruby/info/6cbwo/comments/) I could only notice that some people took offense and some people tried to push the metaphor way too far. At the same time, it generated a lot of interesting discussions even [outside](http://msforums.ph/forums/p/47347/226547.aspx) of our _small_ Ruby community.





## A few clarifications:







  * Rails is an awesome framework, and to be honest I really like the fact that it's accessible to newbies while offering great tools



  * Rails Plugins that I like calling Duplo blocks are great and I use a bunch in most of my projects



  * I, myself wrote a bunch of [plugins and gems](http://github.com/matta/) never as great as the one mentioned in [my post](http://railsontherun.com/2008/3/17/rails-the-duplo-generation) though



  * No, I don't think you are dumb if you don't have a clue how Rails or Rails plugins work






I also agree that the ![Duplo](http://cache.lego.com/upload/contentTemplating/LifestyleProductsBags/otherfiles/1033/uploadF2767709-6EFA-4D99-93FA-13F75766309B.jpg) metaphor is very limited and doesn't stretch... but who cares.. it's funny.





## _What did I mean to say_







  * Rails plugins are useful, use them and _ABUSE_ them. Even though most of them are very well written I strongly believe you would become a better developer if you understand how they work.



  * A _Duplo_ doesn't do exactly what you want it to do, don't _bitch_ about it. Try submitting a patch or if you can write your own plugin.



  * If you are using a plugin on a regular basis, give it some love. Submit some documentation, write a blog post, send a thank you email.



  * A great framework and a bunch of nice plugins are awesome tools for developers but they won't replace your brain.






So, there you go, this time around I tried to be more straight forward and I even apologize if I offended you.





Finally, I don't believe the Rails community is a bunch of _obnoxious-arrogant-wannabe-rockstars_, and certainly not a ghetto. We all started as newbies and I hope a lot of newbies will join the fun and learn through Rails and later provide the community with a lot of awesome Duplos!
