Yesterday, [Yehuda Katz annouced Merb 1.0 RC3 released](http://yehudakatz.com/2008/10/29/merb-10-rc3-released/) and today we re released the same version with a hotfix (some dependencies got broken).

Here is a quick sum up:



	
  * improved the testing framework with full [webrat](http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master) integration.

	
  * merb-action-args works with ParseTree 2.x and 3.x.

	
  * improved merb-auth

	
  * dependency â€œparse_treeâ€, :require_as => â€œParseTreeâ€ { # do stuff after the gem is loaded }. You can also pass :immediate => trueÂ Â  (great to use gems from GitHub)

	
  * improved Windows and JRuby support


1.0 final is expected to be released during [Ruby Conf](http://rubyconf.org/).[![](http://merbcamp.com/images/logo.gif)](http://merbcamp.com/video)

On a different note, the [MerbCamp](http://merbcamp.com) videos were [released](http://merbcamp.com/video) today. Check out the videos [there](http://merbcamp.com/video).

A big thank to [Patrick Crowley](http://mokolabs.com/) and [Rob Kaufman](http://notch8.com/) for taking care of the encoding videos.
