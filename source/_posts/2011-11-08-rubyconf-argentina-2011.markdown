During [RubyConf Argentina 2011](http://rubyconfargentina.org/en) in Buenos Aires, Argentina Matt
Aimonetti gave a talk entitled *Inside Ruby: concurrency & garbage collection explained*.

##Description of the talk:

Concurrency in Ruby and Python implementations is quite a hot topic
nowadays. In this talk, Matt will explain how concurrency works for a
language that uses a Global Interpreter Lock and it means concretely.
Finally Aimonetti will also cover Ruby's garbage collector (GC)
and why it's important to understand how automatic memory
management works to get better performance out of your code.
