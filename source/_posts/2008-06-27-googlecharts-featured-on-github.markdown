[Github](http://github.com), probably the most famous social code hosting service just [redesigned their homepage](http://github.com/blog/103-new-homepage) and are now featuring hosted projects.





I got a very good surprise when [Takeo](http://github.com/takeo) from [Powerset](http://powerset.com) & [Stafftool](http://stafftool.com) hall of fame mentioned to me that [Github](http://github.com) picked one of my gems as the first featured project!

By the way, Takeo is also a Googlecharts contributor (+ a Merbist) and I had the honor to be the first one he ever forked!





Another Googlecharts user, [Mokolabs](http://graffletopia.com) from Graffletopia and [iCal Share](http://icalshare.com/) also decided to try Git and Github. In no time he had forked my project, made some modifications and sent me a pull request. w00t w00t!





To celebrate, we released version 1.3.4 with cleaner documentation, and enhanced features.

Thanks to everyone involved in this project. And special kudos to the [GitHub](http://github.com) team for offering such an awesome service!
