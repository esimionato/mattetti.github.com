My name is Matt Aimonetti, and in my free time I work on Apple's open source [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) implementation named [MacRuby](http://macruby.org). I'm also the author of [O'Reilly's MacRuby book](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920000723). As you can imagine, I'm very thankful that Apple initiated the MacRuby project a few years ago and have been an avid supporter. MacRuby is awesome to develop OS X native applications using the Ruby language and even allows you to compile down your apps to machine code. It's a great alternative to Objective-C.

MacRuby is so awesome that Apple is even [using it in its upcoming OS](http://twitter.com/GeorgeBellos/status/41595085179203584). The only problem is that Apple apparently decided to not share MacRuby with other OS X developers and put [MacRuby in the OS private frameworks](http://yfrog.com/h8hhlydj). While this doesn't affect the project itself, it does affect OS X developers like myself who can't link to [Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/)'s private MacRuby framework and are forced to embed MacRuby with their applications.

That's why I have opened a [ticket on Apple radar system](http://bugreporter.apple.com/) to ask that MacRuby be made a public framework.

If you also want Apple to make this change, [please take a minute and let them know](http://bugreporter.apple.com/).
