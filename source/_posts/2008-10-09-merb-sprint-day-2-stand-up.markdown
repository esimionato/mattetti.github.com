We just finished the first stand-up. A stand-up according to the scrum/xp practices is just an occastion to say what you did yesterday, what you are going to do today and any problems you encountered if any.

The stand-up followed a sprint review & retrospective we had last night.

The amount of work done in few hours is just amazing, Carl is almost done setting up a Continuous Integration system, Merb Stack is almost live, Merb Auth is refactored, inline documentation is moving fast and the up and running team is squashing bugs, optimizing processes and writing documentation.
