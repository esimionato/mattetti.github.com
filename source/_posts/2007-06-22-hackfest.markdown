What a pleasant surprise to see that I made it to the top 10 of [workingwithrails.com hackfest](http://www.workingwithrails.com/hackfest/)





![Hackfest: June top 10](http://www.railsontherun.com/assets/2007/6/22/hackfest-topmonth_2.png)





I know it’s not fair that my patch got merged in while other people ([Josh Knowles](http://joshknowles.com) for instance) have outstanding patches waiting to be merged in so he could get in front of me :)





Hopefully my [other patch](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8701) will be merged in before the end of June and I’ll be able to stay in the top ten. But for some reason I doubt that would happen and that’s why I took a screenshot ;)
