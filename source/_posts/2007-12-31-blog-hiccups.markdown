Last night I updated my [Mephisto install](http://mephistoblog.com/) and switched from awful [dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) to awesome [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/). Everything went well until the dreamhost control panel wasn't accessible anymore leaving my site broken for a couple of hours. This should have cleared up by now, but I'm really sorry about that.





I was hoping to launch the site from [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/) with the new design, but the [designer](http://matthewgist.com/) isn't done yet :(





I wish you all a Happy New Year 2008.
