Back home after few days in Portland where I focused on Ruby, Rails and the community.
It was really nice meeting a lot of people and exchanging ideas. Especially regarding Globalite and the other localization/Internationalization plugins.
It was really good to see how the community came together to push Rails to yet another level.





More news later on :)
