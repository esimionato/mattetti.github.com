I'm almost ready to update Globalite with 2 major changes:







  * Support for Chinese (Taiwan, Hong Kong and main land China) thanks to Ivan Chang


  * Better support for Active Record error messages in forms (based on contribution from Ivan)





I'm writing more tests and updating the sample app before releasing the updated version. It should be out in the next few days.
