Here is the geekiest way I found to wish Happy New Year to my IM contacts:

    framework 'ScriptingBridge'
    app = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier("com.apple.iChat")
    original_status = app.statusMessage
    new_year = Time.mktime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0)
    
    loop do
      now = Time.now
      time_left = (new_year - now).ceil
      if time_left > 0
        app.statusMessage = "#{time_left} seconds left until 2010 (EST)"
      else
        app.statusMessage = "Happy New Year 2010!"
        exit
      end
      sleep(1)
    end


If you are alone at home playing WOW,Â  you can also trigger iTunes to play a mp3 file with crowd noise and people shouting '**Happy New Year 2010**'!
