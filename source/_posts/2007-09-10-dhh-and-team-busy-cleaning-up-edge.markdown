[DHH](http://www.loudthinking.com/) and [nzkoz](http://www.koziarski.net/) have been busy this week end cleaning up Edge and   pushing some features to plugins.







  * acts_as_list became a [plugin](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/plugins/acts_as_list) ( [7443](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7443) / [7444](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7444) )


  * in_place editing was also moved out as a [plugin](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/plugins/in_place_editing) ( [7441](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7441) / [7442](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7442) )


  * Scaffold is gone ( [7429](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7429) ) ( [Jordan McKible post](http://tuples.us/2007/09/09/scaffold-is-gone/) )





The Rails core team is trying to keep the core light and agile and I believe it's a good thing. Hopefully we are getting closer to a 2.0 release.
