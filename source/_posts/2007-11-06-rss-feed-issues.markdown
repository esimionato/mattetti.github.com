Few of you contacted me to let me know that my RSS feed was always getting reset up to few times a day. (Thanks [Josh](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/)).





It looks like a [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/) problem, so if you subscribed to the mephisto feed, please switch to [this](http://feeds.feedburner.com/railsontherun) feed:





[http://feeds.feedburner.com/railsontherun](http://feeds.feedburner.com/railsontherun)





I made sure to clean up the blog header so the old mephisto link won't show up.





Sorry about that and thanks for reading.
