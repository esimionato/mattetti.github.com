  * [Foy Savas](http://foysavas.com), author or the "[merb way](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321601636)" wrote a very well written [post on "Rails monoculture"](http://www.foysavas.com/blog/2008/12/25/lets-be-clear-the-rails-monoculture-is-over.html)

	
  * [Pat Eyler](http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/), wrote an article asking if [Rails and Merb would be better together](http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2008/12/rails-and-merb-better-together.html).

	
  * [Ben Aldred](http://www.geekmade.co.uk/), tell people to [stop worrying and start loving Rails 3](http://www.geekmade.co.uk/2008/12/stop-worrying-and-start-loving-rails-3/).

	
  * [fotonauts.com](http://www.fotonauts.com/) a Rails and Merb Photo website developed by an ex-apple team, was [featured in TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/24/fotonauts-opens-up-a-little-more-skip-the-5000-long-waitlist/). Fotonauts is the perfect example of an app that will bain a lot from the merge.

	
  * [Yehuda](http://yehudakatz.com) has been blogging a lot about every single step and even though most people are enjoying a well deserved break, you can read the [details](http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/26/dispatch-from-the-front-lines/) [of](http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/27/status-memorandum/) the [work](http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/29/another-rails-2x3-update/) started on the merge.


Basically, the work started, we are getting familiar with the rails code base and are optimizing things slowly but surely with a focus on testing JRuby. The Merb router is being optimized and ported over to Rails 3.0. Rails and Merb developers will be able to stick to their DSL (so we stay backward compatible). Merb bootloader is also being ported over without breaking the backward compatibility. Finally, ActiveSupport is being broken down in more manageable/independant chunks so people will be able to pick only what they want to use. A "mini" version is also on the work.

	
  * [Merb 1.0.7 got released](http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/28/merb-107-release-notes/) yesterday with a bunch of bug fixes.

	
  * merb_sequel 1.0 should be released sometime this week and i'm planning on adding rails i18n syntax support to merb_babel.
