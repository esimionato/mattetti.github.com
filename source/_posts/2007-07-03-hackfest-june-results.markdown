I received an email today from O'Reilly UK, letting me know that I won a book of my choosing :)





Don't believe that they are just emailing random people to offer them software development books (that would be cool though). O'Reilly is simply saying thank you for my contribution to the Rails core:

If you also want to thank me (for anything you want, really), feel free to send me cheques, books, food, coupons/vouchers, cash, animals under 15 pounds but above 2 or plane tickets.
