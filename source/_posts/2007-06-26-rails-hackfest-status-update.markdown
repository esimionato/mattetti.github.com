![Hackfest status 4 days before the end of the month](http://www.railsontherun.com/assets/2007/6/26/hackfest-4.png)





The [Rails hackfest](http://www.workingwithrails.com/hackfest/12-monthly-june-2-7) is a chance for people to be rewarded for contributing source code to Ruby On Rails. The value of their contributions are accumulated and the results charted.





I’m honored to be listed as contributor number 4 few days before the end of the month.
I know I got lucky with some of my patches getting merged in and that I might not be able to stay in the top 10, but I’m still glad I was able to help.
