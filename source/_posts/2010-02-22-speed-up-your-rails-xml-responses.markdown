At [work](http://www.us.playstation.com/), we have an XML API that gets quite a lot of traffic. Last week I looked into improving its performance since we are expecting more traffic soon and want to make sure our response time is optimized.

My first thought was to make sure we hadÂ  an optimized [ActiveSupport's xmlmini backend](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/XmlMini.html). Rails 2.3.5 fixed some issues when using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) as a xmlmini so I switched to my favorite Ruby XML lib:

    
    ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend = 'Nokogiri'


I run some benchmarks using ab, httperf and jmeter but the results were not that great. I was so sure that switching from [rexml](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/index.html) to [nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) would give me awesome results that I was very disappointed.

I was about to call [Aaron Patterson](http://tenderlovemaking.com/) (Nokogiri's author) to insult him, blame him for _why's disappearance and tell him that all his pro bono efforts were useless since my own app was not running much faster when switched to his library. As I was about to dial his number on my iPhone I had a crazy thought... maybe it was not Aaron's fault, maybe it was mine.

So I took a break went to play some fuzzball and as I was being ridiculed by Italian coworker, Emanuele, I realized that most of our API calls were just simple HTTP requests with no XML payload, just some query params. However, we were generating a lot of XML to send back to the client and AS::XmlMini only takes care of the XML parsing, not the rendering.

The XML rendering is done by [Jim Weirich](http://onestepback.org/)'s pure Ruby [builder library](http://builder.rubyforge.org/) which is vendored in Rails. Builder does a good job, but I thought that maybe a C based library might improve the speed. A coworker of mine (James Bunch) recommended to look into [faster-builder](http://github.com/codahale/faster-builder), a drop-in Builder replacement based on libxml. Unfortunately, the project doesn't seem to be maintained and I decided to look into using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) XML builder instead. (Also, faster-builder's author doesn't like me very much while Aaron knows he's one of my Ruby heroes so asking for help could be easier)

Some people reported having tried using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) as a XML builder but didn't see much speed improvement. Because of the amount of magic required to render a rxml template, I was not really surprised but I decided to contact Aaron and ask him if he tried using his lib instead of builder in a Rails app. [Aaron](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronp/57241193/) told me he gave it a try a while back and he helped me get my Rails app setup to render xml templates using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/).

The next step was simple, create a [benchmark app](http://github.com/mattetti/noko-vs-builder-benchmark) and benchmark Builder vs Nokogiri using various templates. Here are the results I got using Ruby 1.9.1 (the Ruby version we use in production) and two sets of templates:

**Builder** small template, **time per request: 15.507 [ms]** (mean)

Running the benchmarks many times showed that Nokogiri and Builder were taking more or less the same amount of time to builder a small template.

I then decided to try a bigger template, closer to what we have in production, here are the results:

**Nokogiri** longer template, **time per request: 31.252 [ms] (mean)**

Wow, [@tenderlove](http://twitter.com/tenderlove)'s Nokogori just brought us a** 4.5X speed improvement for this specific template**.Â  100ms per request is probably not a big deal for most people and I have to say that Jim did a great job with Builder. However in my specific case, 100ms on a request being called thousands of times per hour is quite important.

(The [benchmark app is available on github](http://github.com/mattetti/noko-vs-builder-benchmark), feel free to fork it and benchmark your own templates)

Who would have thought that a man like this could save the day?!
