I had people asking me how come I was not blogging as much lately. Well, on top of being really busy, I have been blogging on other blogs such as the [official Rails blog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/).

There aren't a lot of Merb news, we are waiting for Carl and Yehuda to sign out on the 1.1 release and will hopefully soon start the migration work to Rails3. If you want more news about Rails3, check [Yehuda's blog](http://yehudakatz.com/) and the [official Rails blog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/). Lots of exciting things are coming up.

Finally, if you are planning on upgrading your Mac to Snow Leopard, [these instructions](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/8/30/upgrading-to-snow-leopard) are also valid for all Ruby developers on an Intel mac.
