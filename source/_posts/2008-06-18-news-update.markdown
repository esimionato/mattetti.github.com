I realized I haven't updated this blog in a while. Here is a quick update on what's happened and on things to come:







  * [RailsConf 08](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home). Great conference, probably my last Rails Conf though. I'll be in Orlando for [Ruby Conf 08](http://rubyconf.org/) and I'll focus on 1 or 2 local conferences (probably [mountain west](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/) and another one).



  * MerbCamp 08 in San Diego this Fall organized by [SD Ruby](http://sdruby.com). Details are not finalized yet but [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) announced it during his Merb talk at RailsConf.



  * Moved this blog to a new [Joyent accelerator](http://joyent.com) with git support and finally have the possibility to use Ambition! (planning on moving from Mephisto to [Feather](http://crazycool.co.uk/2008/04/26/announcing-feather))



  * Launched a client's Merb app and getting around 3 million hits/day. Merb is just awesome. (more info when the client's app gets out of beta)



  * I'll join [Gregg Pollack](http://railsenvy.com/) from [http://railsenvy.com/](http://railsenvy.com/) during [Qcon](http://qcon.infoq.com) and take part in the [Ruby for the Enterprise](http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco-2008/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=172) track. [My talk](http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco-2008/speaker/Matt+Aimonetti) will focus on Merb usage in real life.



  * Renamed my github username, new repo url: [http://github.com/mattetti](http://github.com/mattetti) (sorry about that)
