Yes, it is true and no, I am not being [passive aggressive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior) or cynical.

As you might have heard there has been some tension between the Rails team and the Merb team in the last few weeks. Sometimes caused by us, sometimes caused by them. I already addressed this issue in [this blog post](http://merbist.com/2008/11/15/rails-vs-merb-drama/), so let's move on.

[![Mac vs PC - Matt Aimonetti](http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mac_pc-267x300.png)](http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mac_pc.png)Let me first explain the reason for this blog post.** I believe we have a great community but I also believe we like bashing**.

Like most Rubyists, I use a mac and I often smile when I watch their ads. Then I see Microsoft's response ad and I think ... they don't get it, I'm not a Mac, the dude on TV represents the Mac computer. I'm a human.

Thinking back to our community, I felt that it quickly became: 'Hi, I'm a Rails developer' and 'Hi I'm a Merb developer'.

**What started as a simple comparison to explain what the difference was between Merb and Rails quickly escalated into arguments about what framework is best and which one people should use.**

I hear people in the Ruby community talking trash about Rails and criticize the Rails core team. I even saw people insulting DHH on IRC while he was not even on the channel.

I, myself, have to admit that I have been guilty of crossing the line a few times and have made some comments which can be considered as "bashing".

**I think now is a good time to apologize and to say that this kind of behavior is not appropriate.**

After all, if we wanted to define ourselves as being "something" we probably should say: "Hi, I'm a Ruby developer". Rails is not perfect, nor is Merb. I might disagree with some of the decisions made by the Rails core team but I still think Rails is a great framework and the Rails team has done an awesome job and deserves a lot of respect for its efforts. We are all part of the Ruby community and I think it's time we all (starting by myself) act as a unified community.

Without further ado, here is my ...


### Top 10 reasons why we <3 Rails:





	
  * Without Rails, the Ruby language would not be [one of the top 10 programming languages](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index/index.htm)

	
  * Without Rails, we would still be writing [thousand-line configuration files in XML](http://www.skywayradio.com/tech/iSeries/wps/admxmsmp.html) to start your small app

	
  * Without Rails, most developers would not know what [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) stands for

	
  * Without Rails, I would not be a Ruby web developer

	
  * Without Rails, we would not have [Merb](http://merbivore.com)

	
  * Without Rails, we would not have all the other cool Ruby frameworks

	
  * Without Rails, [testing](http://rspec.info) would be something only the elite would do

	
  * Without Rails, serving Ruby web apps would be a pain in the neck

	
  * Without Rails, [Zed Shaw](http://www.zedshaw.com/) would not be famous


Bonus items:

	
  * Without Matz, there would be no Ruby

	
  * Without Ruby, there would be no Rails


Next time you think, I'm a Merb or I'm a Rails, think twice :)
