As many of you know, I'm a great [RSpec](http://rspec.rubyforge.org/) and [autotest](http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/) fan.





Last night, I upgraded my MacBook to from Tiger to Leopard and I everything went very well... apart that Autotest stopped notifying me using Growl when my tests pass or fail :(





Growl itself works fine, even when using spaces. 





However _[growlNotify](http://www.growl.info/documentation/growlnotify.php)_, the [Growl](http://www.growl.info/) plugin used by autotest _doesn't seem to be Leopard compatible yet_. 





Just thought you guys should know that before upgrading.
