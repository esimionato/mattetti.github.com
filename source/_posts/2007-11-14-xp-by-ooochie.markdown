[Lindsay](http://ooochie.com) from the [Integrum](http://integrumtech.com) hall of fame wrote 3 nice (short) articles about Extreme Programming (XP).







  * [XP part I - XP values ](http://ooochie.com/2007/10/3/extreme-programming-part-1)


  * [XP part II - XP principles](http://ooochie.com/2007/10/10/extreme-programming-part-2)


  * [XP part III - practices](http://ooochie.com/2007/10/27/extreme-programming-part-3)





I really enjoyed reading her posts and I can really recommend you spend few minutes going through her explanations. 





If you are in San Diego, check the [XP San Diego group](http://www.xpsd.org/cgi-bin/wiki). Unfortunately, the XPSD group meets at the same time as the SDRuby group, but we'll try to work something out.





In the mean time, I hope to see [Ooochie ](http://ooochie.com) sharing more of her own experience with Extreme Programming.
