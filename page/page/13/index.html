    <div class="entry">
        <p>Lately, I have been really busy with my <a href="http://ma-agile.com">business</a>, an <a href="http://merbclass.com">upcoming training</a> and some non rails-merb related experimentations. (I&#8217;m learning objective-c and playing with <a href="http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/MacRuby">macruby</a>)</p>

<p>However, here are some of the latest news:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Merb 1.0.8 should be released soon with some bug fixes and some improvements</p></li>
<li><p>The Merb book got 2 new sections, Sequel and Active Record. I&#8217;ll be spending quite a lot of time on the book in the next weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ted Han is working on reorganizing the <a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com">Merb wiki</a></p></li>
<li><p>We started a new mailing list for people wanting to help with the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-wiki">Rails wiki</a></p></li>

    <div class="entry">
        <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/379744976_8f241811fe_m.jpg" alt="Matt Aimonetti interviewing Hampton Catlin" /></p>

<p>Meet today&#8217;s merbist: <a href="http://hamptoncatlin.com/">Hampton Catlin</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m personally looking forward to seeing Hampton&#8217;s work migrated to Rails 3 in a few months.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong>: Hi Hampton, could you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do for a living.</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin: </strong>I&#8217;m Hampton Catlin. I&#8217;m &#8220;The Haml Guy&#8221; as I&#8217;m apparently termed all the time when introduced. I&#8217;m an early Rails hacker who has done a lot more than Haml, but whatever. These days, I&#8217;m doing a ton of iPhone development and am currently heading Wikimedia&#8217;s efforts for a new mobile platform&#8230; based on Merb!</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong>: How did you get started with Ruby, what&#8217;s your background?</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin</strong>: Well, everyone is welcome to laugh. But Slashdot introduced me to Ruby. I got into it about two months before Rails because the hotness (it was an obscure project at the time) and I grabbed a copy of the Pickaxe and never looked back. Prior to that I was working a crappy job getting people coffee at a bank. And then prior to that I was doing research for Nasa at my university with Java beuwolf clusters. It sounds fancier than it was.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> You chose to learn and use Merb, could you please let us know why and how that happened?</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin: </strong>I had known of Ezra for a while and Yehuda. And so when I heard about the project, I was very interested. At the time I was looking forward to using a &#8220;Rails Light&#8221;. Of course, we know Merb is much more than that, but that was the original attraction.</p>

<p>Also, at some point I got really upset by the use of global variables in both of the frameworks, so I did some major patching to Merb to change over to module based constants. Aka, Merb.root instead of MERB_ROOT. I was ranting about it enough that I decided to do something about it. Also, I did some patches that messed up Merb with some weird documentation stuff. Sorry, Ezra.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong>: Do you have some Merb projects available online we can look at? what was your experience so far?</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin</strong>: My most successful iPhone app (which was recently purchased by Wikimedia) was an app to browse Wikipedia. I chose Merb because I knew that I wanted something a little more bare bones than Rails, and it turned out to be a really good choice. And now, I&#8217;m getting a chance to extend that work into an entire platform for Wikimedia mobile. I am still looking for help with it&#8230;.<a href="http://github.com/hcatlin/wikimedia-mobile/tree/master">http://github.com/hcatlin/wikimedia-mobile/tree/master</a>
Its not live yet with wikipedia, but that&#8217;s the code that you can help with! :)</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> What is your favorite aspect of the Merb framework?</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin: </strong>Its modular design. Its as complex or as simple as you would like it to be. Also, its easy to run Haml, and the more people that use Haml, the harder my nipples get.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> Could you please mention an aspect of Merb you hope to see being improved in the near future?</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin</strong>: Honestly, everyone is wild about gems, but I&#8217;m not particularly. I find gem management a bit cumbersome. I&#8217;m most likely doing something wrong or not doing it the right way. But yeah, I still find it cumbersome. I&#8217;d like to pair the excellent Gem support with better library creation support. I think both are needed. I don&#8217;t want to throw stuff in my /lib folder or randomly in my project. I want some structure and some simplicity. Somewhere between plugins and base libraries. I think this is where Merb <em>could</em> shine.</p>

<p>Also, resource handling. I wrote make_resourceful for Rails and I keep needing to do something similar for Merb. m_r is not very popular because I haven&#8217;t really put much time into spreading the word. Mostly, I just use it. However, there are about 60 other Rails developers in the world that use it extensively. So, its a small, close-knit group of developers using the tool. And, I think something like it could be much more elegantly mixed into Merb. Obviously its a plug-in, but I think its a low hanging fruit. &#8220;current_object&#8221; as a method should ALWAYS be around when its logical.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> Thank you for your time. Anything else you would like to add?</p>

<p><strong>Hampton Catlin</strong>: Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Ok, not really. My book isn&#8217;t very good. But, I just wanted to make a &#8220;The Critic&#8221; reference.</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2009/01/05/presenting-the-rails-activists/">Presenting the Rails Activists</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Today is Monday. I usually don&#8217;t like Mondays.
Being Monday goes with waking up early, going back to work, and lots of deadlines.</p>

<p>However, today is a special Monday. It&#8217;s the first Monday of the year and I have a <strong>special announcement</strong>!</p>

<p>During the Rails/Merb merge announcement, it was mentioned that I will be joining the soon to be created <strong>&#8220;Evangelism team&#8221;</strong>.</p>

<p>A few people asked me what being a <strong>&#8220;Rails Evangelist&#8221;</strong> means. To reassure my parents and close friends, no, <em>I didn&#8217;t join a new cult worshiping locomotives</em>. However, I still think that public transportation should be improved, especially in this time of crisis (but that&#8217;s a different topic).</p>

<p>A technical evangelist, is usually someone who knows and uses a specific technology and thinks others should look into it. This is something I&#8217;ve been doing for Merb while being part of the core team. I initiated and helped organizing MerbCamp, re-did the wiki, started working on the merb-book, spent time looking for and listening to users, spent time with third party developers and people pushing Merb to a new level (YellowPages, Wikimedia and many others).</p>

<p>This interaction with the end users and the third party developers is something the entire Merb team valued a great deal and I always felt it was something the community really appreciated.</p>

<p>As part of the merge, it was agreed that we would push things further and have a team within the Rails team to take care of &#8220;communication&#8221;. Rails is a bigger project than Merb and communication between the dev team and the users isn&#8217;t always something easy to do.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why we have formed a separate team that will help communicate and support the community better. We now even have <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/activists">an official page on the Rails website</a> itself :)</p>

<h2>The Rails Activists</h2>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ateam.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ateam-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></a>The A-Team <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/1/5/announcing-the-rails-activists">just got announced on the Rails blog</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of being called &#8220;evangelists&#8221;, we are going to be called &#8220;activists&#8221;. I think part of the argument was that the E-Team doesn&#8217;t sound as good as the A-Team.</p>

<p>We started with team of 4. You might not know them yet but they all are brilliant people and I&#8217;m really glad to be working with them.</p>

<p><img src="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/assets/2009/1/4/gregg_pollack.png" alt="" /><strong>Gregg Pollack</strong>, from Rails Envy. You might remember Gregg from the Rails vs * commercials or from the Rails Envy podcasts. I&#8217;ve known Gregg for a little while and he&#8217;s someone you can rely on and always full of energy/new ideas.</p>

<p><img src="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/assets/2009/1/4/ryan_bates.png" alt="" /><strong>
Ryan Bates</strong>, mainly known for his Railscasts. I only met Ryan once in person, but I&#8217;ve always been impressed by his work (don&#8217;t tell anyone, but I secretly dreamt of having something like Railscasts but for Merb :) )</p>

<p><img src="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/assets/2009/1/4/mike_gunderloy.png" alt="" /><strong>Mike Gunderloy</strong>. I actually did not know Mike but I have read and enjoyed his <a href="http://afreshcup.com/">blog</a> and have seen his work on the Rails guides. Mike is an experienced writer and developer. He joked the other day saying that he started programming before any member of the Rails team was even born. Mike is a great addition to the team and I&#8217;m looking forward to learning from his experience.</p>

<p>Gregg and Ryan also covered the event, you might want to check their blog posts (<a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/1/5/the-rails-activist-team">Gregg&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://afreshcup.com/2009/01/05/announcing-the-rails-activists/">Mike&#8217;s</a>)</p>

<h2>So what are we going to do?</h2>

<p>Pretty simple. We&#8217;ve boiled it down to 2 sentences:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mission of the Rails Activists is to empower and support the worldwide network of Ruby on Rails users. We do this by publicizing Rails, making adoption easier, and enhancing developer support.</p></blockquote>

<p>if you prefer a few more details, here are some of the tasks we are going to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public Relations with media of all sizes</p></li>
<li><p>Ombudsman work to ensure good user-to-user support</p></li>
<li><p>Community Leadership at events and conferences</p></li>
<li><p>Media Organization to help create good promotional opportunities</p></li>
<li><p>Website maintenance</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation efforts</p></li>
<li><p>Developer support</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Do we need help?</h2>

<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> The idea is not that we are going to do all the work. The concept of this new team is to help organize the community. We are going to build a Rails Network, a network of people involved in local Rails &#8220;evangelism&#8221;/activism, people contributing and/or translating documentation, third part developers etc&#8230;</p>

<p>First thing would be to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-activism">join the mailing list</a> and share your suggestions, comments, concerns, etc., with us.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have already set up some forums to hear your feedback.</p>

<p>To start off, we are asking people to let us know what they <a href="http://rails.uservoice.com/">would like to see happening in the Rails3 timeframe</a>.
We have other forums for more <a href="http://rails.uservoice.com/pages/general_feedback">general feedback</a>, but we need to work with deadlines so we can prioritize accordingly. Using the Rails3 milestone should help us focus on a short/medium term deadline. <a href="http://rails.uservoice.com/pages/rails_future">Long term and not specific suggestions</a> are welcome in the other forums.</p>

<p>Finally, contact us. You can find multiple ways to do so on the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/activists">activism team web page</a>.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/">Pat Eyler</a>, wrote an article asking if <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2008/12/rails-and-merb-better-together.html">Rails and Merb would be better together</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.fotonauts.com/">fotonauts.com</a> a Rails and Merb Photo website developed by an ex-apple team, was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/24/fotonauts-opens-up-a-little-more-skip-the-5000-long-waitlist/">featured in TechCrunch</a>. Fotonauts is the perfect example of an app that will bain a lot from the merge.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda</a> has been blogging a lot about every single step and even though most people are enjoying a well deserved break, you can read the <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/26/dispatch-from-the-front-lines/">details</a> <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/27/status-memorandum/">of</a> the <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/29/another-rails-2x3-update/">work</a> started on the merge.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, the work started, we are getting familiar with the rails code base and are optimizing things slowly but surely with a focus on testing JRuby. The Merb router is being optimized and ported over to Rails 3.0. Rails and Merb developers will be able to stick to their DSL (so we stay backward compatible). Merb bootloader is also being ported over without breaking the backward compatibility. Finally, ActiveSupport is being broken down in more manageable/independant chunks so people will be able to pick only what they want to use. A &#8220;mini&#8221; version is also on the work.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/28/merb-107-release-notes/">Merb 1.0.7 got released</a> yesterday with a bunch of bug fixes.</p></li>

People who used to argue and not get along, have decided to sit down, talk and evaluate their differences. The end result is a strong collaboration of two teams who share the exact same goal.</p>

<p>Overall, the news was very well received, just look at the tweets out there and the comments on <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/">Yehuda&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3">Rails&#8217; blogs</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the Rails community really embraced this decision and just got totally excited about the perspective of merging merb&#8217;s philosophy and expertise into Rails. If you re-read David&#8217;s blog post you can see that it&#8217;s a <strong>real homage to Merb</strong>.</p>

<p>The rest of the internet sounds pretty happy about the news, here are few posts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081224-ruby-on-rails-and-merb-to-merge-for-rails-3.html">arstechnica.com</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3793296/Merb+Merges+With+Rails.htm">internetnews</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Even <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com">Zed the entertainer</a> thought it was a good thing:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/index.html">&#8220;I honestly didnâ€™t think that would ever happen. I just assumed that Merb
would eventually wipe out Rails by being the better framework, or theyâ€™d
wipe each other out soon.</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/index.html">So, congrats are in order. You guys are finally grown-ups and now have
the chance to make something better.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Some <a href="http://iamruinous.com/2008/12/23/why-merb-becoming-rails-3-is-a-good-thing/">merbists like Jade Meskill</a> really understood what we are trying to do while some other ones got really <a href="http://www.mr-eel.com/archives/158">mad at us</a>.</p>

<p>I think a pattern emerged from the negative reactions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why merge when we are about to win?!</p></li>
<li><p>What does Merb win by being merged into Rails?</p></li>
<li><p>Why not merge Rails into Merb?</p></li>
<li><p>You are killing innovation by killing the competition</p></li>
<li><p>You screwed us over and now I have to go &#8220;back&#8221; to Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Rails 3.0 won&#8217;t even be as good as Merb 1.x</p></li>
<li><p>The Rails team won&#8217;t let you do what you have to do to merge Merb into Rails</p></li>
<li><p>DHH is a jerk</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let me quote Yehuda:Â  <strong>&#8220;Calm yourselves ;)&#8221;</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why merge when we are about to win?!</h2>

<p>This is probably the most rational argument. This is also something the Merb core team considered for a little bit.
Merb is gaining huge momentum and the target audience was very reactive to what we did.
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mhaithaca/1317815300/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1087/1317815300_095983272e_m.jpg" alt="" /></a>People such as Yellow Pages, Wikipedia and even Adobe started using or looking seriously at Merb because of its focus on modularity and performance.
We started building an elite community and we were pretty proud of that.</p>

<p>But take a moment to think about it. Our goal has never been to hurt or compete with Rails. Our goals were to get modularity, performance and a strong API. If the Rails team really wants that, and will work on it, why should we work against each other?
It&#8217;s not about winning or losing. It&#8217;s all about the long term plan of your framework, about the people involved and the community behind it. We had to take ourselves out of the equation and consider what would be good for the Ruby community.</p>

<h2>What does Merb win by being merged into Rails?</h2>

<p>People seem to easily find things we might lose but have a hard time finding things we are gaining.
<img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rails.png" alt="" />Looking at it on the very short term, this is probably correct. The merb team will have to learn how to work with the Rails team.
We need to understand the reasons behind every single aspect of the code and find ways of merging things nicely.
On top of that, we still need to work on merb as promised. (see Wycats&#8217; post)</p>

<p>However, in the long term we get all the benefits of Rails:
- stability
- community
- traction
- experience
- don&#8217;t have to always justify why use Merb instead of Rails</p>

<p>But more importantly, we extend our team.</p>

<p>Most people using a framework might not realize what it is to work on a big Open Source project.
When you work on an OSS project, people come and go, and that&#8217;s why you usually have a core team of people you can rely on.
Merb has a lot of contributors but a small core team of 5 people (Yehuda, Carl, Daniel, Michael and myself).
Managing a project, such as merb, requires a tremendous amount of time and patience. Rails has the same problem with its core team of 6 people. People have lives, business, projects etc&#8230;</p>

<p>Joining two teams of experts in developing web frameworks in Ruby is like if in the next Soccer World Cup, the French and Italian teams would go on the fields at the same time to beat other teams. 22 players on 1 side, training and learning together. American readers, please imagine the Giants and the Colts facing the Green Bay Packers (I was told I don&#8217;t like the Packers).</p>

<p>Long term, you will get better quality and more frequent releases. We also have different world views and backgrounds which means we will learn a lot from each other, again that means better code for you guys :)</p>

<h2>Why not merge Rails into Merb?</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s actually a good question. We discussed maybe using merb-core as a base for Rails 3.0
The truth is that Merb 2.0 would probably be as big as Rails but more modular.
So we have the choice to keep on building on top of Merb 2.0 or deconstruct Rails.
As the Russians say: &#8216;Ð»Ð¾Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚ÑŒ â€” Ð½Ðµ ÑÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð¸Ñ‚ÑŒ&#8217;, it&#8217;s always easier to take things apart ;)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/2814371262_04b9876490_m.jpg" alt="" />Rails already has a test suite, it has already been tested on the wild for a while and its internals are known to many developers. Taking apart the code to make it faster, cleaner and more modular is arguably easier than reinventing the wheel. At the end of the day it doesn&#8217;t really matter from which end you start as long as you end up with the same result.</p>

<p>Some people even asked to come up with a new name for the merged project. Meails, Mr Ails, Reverb, Reab were suggested. While I thought it was a joke, some people were really serious. Can you imagine if during the recent bailout, banks changed names every time they were purchased by another bank? People would be super confused and would not even know where to send their mortgage payments.
On top of that, Rails has a huge user base compared to Merb and has an immense brand recognition in the world at large, it would be foolish to throw that away.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s not be chauvinistic and see what&#8217;s best for all.</p>

<h2>You are killing innovation by killing the competition</h2>

<p>Again, a good point but my question to you is: Should we stay in the competition just for the sake of it?</p>

<p>Rails clearly told us: we want what you have and we would love you to work with us. So the options were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>tell them to go to hell and let them try to redo what we already did and know how to do.</p></li>
<li><p>accept to work with them and make Rails a better framework.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>Option 1</em> would keep the competition alive, but now you have 2 groups of people trying to do the same thing and being better at different aspects. The community gets confused and communication breaks.</p>

<p><em>Option 2</em>: we lose the Merb vs Rails competition, but we double the amount of people working on Rails and therefore increase the change to make it better faster.</p>

<p>We went for option 2 and we know there is already some competition out there and there will be more coming up soon. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic to expect us not to merge because we want to keep the competition going.</p>

<h2>You screwed us over and now I have to go &#8220;back&#8221; to Rails</h2>

<p>Yehuda will blog about some more detailed examples as we are making progress, but you need to stop thinking that Merb will just be absorbed into Rails.
If Rails just wanted to add some &#8220;Merb flavor&#8221; to Rails, they would have just taken whatever they needed and would not be interested in a merge.
See Rails 3.0 as a new generation of Rails, whatever we promised you for merb 2.0 plus all the goodies from Rails. Rails users will still have their default stack and all choices will be made for them (like in the current Merb stack). The difference for standard Rails user will be better performance, a static API and an option to go off the &#8220;golden path&#8221;.
Merbists won&#8217;t lose the stuff they like in Merb, stacks, full support for DataMapper, Sequel and other ORMS, jQuery or other JS library, opt-in solution using just rails-core, better core isolation, built-in RSpec and webrat support, slices, merb-cache, merb-auth and all the other key plugins that will be ported over.</p>

<p>To be able to achieve all of that, we will have to make some infrastructure and code modifications.</p>

<p>Rails internals should end up:</p>

<ul>
<li>way less magical (even Merb uses some magic, but we&#8217;ll make sure to keep it to a minimum)</li>
<li>returning shorter and cleaner stack traces</li>
<li>cleaner (required for the new API)</li>
<li>better isolated (required to increase the modularity)</li>
<li>alias_method_chain won&#8217;t be available at the public API level (we probably still will need some chaining mechanism internally, but that&#8217;s a different story)</li>
</ul>


<p>So, no, you don&#8217;t have to go &#8220;back&#8221; to Rails. In fact, imagine you could do exactly what Rails does but with the performance and modular architecture of Merb. That&#8217;s what you will get with Rails 3.0.</p>

<h2>Rails 3.0 won&#8217;t even be as good as Merb 1.x</h2>

<p>I think I mainly replied to this question in my previous answer.
There is no reason why Rails 3.0 won&#8217;t be better than Merb 1.x.Â  Actually, I believe our API will actually be even better. With the help of David, the existing Rails core team, and the Rails community, we will be able to define an awesome API that will change the way ruby web development will be done.
The merb API is great but we already know some of its limitations and we don&#8217;t have as many plugin developers to work with. Working with plugin developers is something I&#8217;m personally excited about. As a Rails developer I have been really frustrated when using 3rd party plugins and trying to develop my own.
Having a well tested, developed against, public API will make all the Rails 3.0 plugins so much better. And because Merb plugins already use an API, we will be able to port all the plugins over, so it will be at least as good as 1.x
Also, we are going to work on real app benchmark tests to make sure the performance gain is at least as good as what we have with Merb.</p>

<p>Migration will be easy and well documented. We are not giving up on the Merb book and it will be very useful to explain the Merb way to new comers wanting an idea of the new stuff in Rails 3.0. It will also be the best source of information to migrate your app to Rails 3.0.</p>

<p>Talking about migration, we promised to give you a sane migration path when it will be time to migrate.
Again, don&#8217;t freak out because we are changing the name, the spirit of Merb will keep on living.</p>

<h2>The Rails team won&#8217;t let you do what you have to do to merge Merb into Rails</h2>

<p>In all honestly, I was worried about that. I was wondering if all of that was not an evil scam planned by DHH to kill Merb as it was getting a good momentum. I like conspiracy theories and it sounded pretty good.
To my surprised, after a few private conversations with David, I realized that he was genuinely interested in making Rails better for people and fulfill the needs of people who need more flexibility.
Just re-read his blog post <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3">http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3</a>. After what he said, how can he back up and just keep Rails the way it is? And why in the world would he want that to happen?
It&#8217;s a team effort and we have already spent hours and hours discussing some details. I can promise you that the Rails team is very excited about the new stuff that&#8217;s coming up. But don&#8217;t forget that it&#8217;s a merge and we are reconsidering some of the stuff we did in Merb to better re-implement them in Rails 3.0.
So far, I haven&#8217;t seen any of the Rails core team member tell us, no you can&#8217;t do that because that&#8217;s not the way it&#8217;s done in Rails or because we just don&#8217;t like it.</p>

<h2>DHH is a jerk</h2>

<p>Recently, in an interview I gave to rubylearning.com <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/18/matt-aimonetti-why-on-earth-would-you-ignore-merb/">http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/18/matt-aimonetti-why-on-earth-would-you-ignore-merb/</a> I mentioned that a big difference between Merb and Rails was the way we were dealing with the user base.
I quoted David from an Interview he gave to InfoQ <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/David-Hansson">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/David-Hansson</a> back in 2006.</p>

<p>As part of the merging evaluation process we literally spent hours talking back and forth. I had a seriously hard time believing that Rails and David honestly wanted to change their world views. How can you go from saying what you said in 2006 to adopting what Merb is pushing for: letting the framework bend to make what each developer wants if he doesn&#8217;t want to follow the &#8220;golden path&#8221;?</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, David recently addressed this point on his blog. <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/36-work-on-what-you-use-and-share-the-rest">http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/36-work-on-what-you-use-and-share-the-rest</a></p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to take a few minutes to address some concerns of the last 4%. The people who feel like this might not be such a good idea. And in particular, the people who feel like it might not be such a good idea because of various things that I&#8217;ve said or done over the years.&#8221;</p>

<p>First thing first, David addresses the minority of people worried about his image and what it means for them.
So, David actually cares about hard core merbists and he wants them to join the fun. I personally see this as something very encouraging!</p>

<p>A recurring theme we hear a lot is that Rails becomes whatever DHH/37signals needs/wants. If DHH needs something new, it will make it to Rails, if he doesn&#8217;t need it, it won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>David has a very simple and almost shocking response: DHH != Rails</p>

<p>David is really happy with Rails. Rails satisfies his needs but he knows that some people out there need/want something more/different.</p>

<p>&#8220;I personally use all of those default choices, so do many other Rails programmers. The vanilla ride is a great one and it&#8217;ll remain a great one. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be the only one. There are lots of reasons why someone might want to use Data Mapper or Sequel instead of Active Record. I won&#8217;t think of them any less because they do. In fact, I believe Rails should have open arms to such alternatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, you can still think whatever you want about David. What&#8217;s important is that Rails is more than David. It&#8217;s an entire team of people with different needs and different views.</p>

<p>DHH isn&#8217;t a dictator and based on concrete examples such as the &#8220;respond_to vs provides&#8221; discussion, I can reassure you that David has been very receptive to arguments and never tried to force any decision because he thought it was better.</p>
