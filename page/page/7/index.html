    <div class="entry">
        <p>It is now official: I have traded my freedom &amp; home office for a job title, an Aeron chair in a cubicle and a 401K.</p>

<p>I received my new employee package and, in less than a week, I will officially become a full-time employee atÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_of_America"> SCEA</a> (Sony Computer Entertainment America).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to work in the PlayStation department, working on PS3, PS2 and PSP game titles developed by <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com/">various</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCE_Studio_San_Diego">game</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_Worldwide_Studios">studios</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sony_playstation_32.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sony_playstation_32-300x206.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h3>Why &#8216;o why?</h3>

<p><em>Why leave behind a happy life of indie contracting to join corporate America?</em></p>

<p>For many reasons actually:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Team</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Being a consultant I have been working with other independent consultants and existing teams. Nonetheless, I really miss being part of a stable team which grows together and learns from each other as we go through new projects and maintain old ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long term plan</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>As a consultant, I usually start projects or &#8220;rescue&#8221; existing projects. I work on them for a little while and then move on. It&#8217;s exciting and rewarding but you don&#8217;t really pay the consequences of your mistakes. You usually don&#8217;t have to maintain the code you wrote and you rarely deal with the mistakes <em>you</em> made.</p>

<p>It sounds good, nobody likes to maintain the crappy awesome code they wrote 2 years ago and most developers love working on new stuff. But at the same time, to become a better engineer you need to learn from you mistakes and assuming responsibility for your bad decisions is part of the process.</p>

<p>It might sound weird, but I&#8217;m actually excited to work on long term projects and feel some sort of ownership over the projects. Having to support games for many years means that I&#8217;d better not mess up the implementation. And if I do, I hope I&#8217;ll quickly learn from my mistakes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoiding burn out</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>There is no secret: when you are passionate about what you do, you have a hard time stopping and taking a break. I&#8217;m a recovering workaholic and it&#8217;s really hard for me to say no when I&#8217;m presented the possibility to work on interesting projects. I love what I do and I keep writing code even after I&#8217;m done with client work.</p>

<p>The problem is that this can start me on the slippery slope to isolating myself from friends, family and people who don&#8217;t share the same passion. I&#8217;m really lucky that my wife is a geek and loves hanging out at conferences, looking at code and playing with my buggy prototypes. But still, I spend too much time &#8220;playing&#8221; with my computer and I just can&#8217;t manage my free time wisely.</p>

<p>Having a full time position will hopefully help me put boundaries and will hopefully teach me to disconnect from work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exciting projects</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Hey, let&#8217;s be honest, how many geeks do you know don&#8217;t want to work in the video game industry? By the way, if you don&#8217;t have a PS3, they are now at $299 and on top of getting an awesome console you get a blue ray player! (And no, I do not receive any bonuses or commissions for mentioning the console or promoting it in my blog. I had to pay for my own like everyone else.)</p>

<h3>Corporate America? Are you going to write Java now?</h3>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/1264424156_24f4571b10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m mainly going to stick to the language I love: <strong>Ruby</strong>.
From time to time I will probably use other languages here and there, but that usually makes me love Ruby even more. The reality is that Ruby&#8217;s power and flexibility seem to be appreciated by SCEA, which makes sense when you have tight deadlines and a lot of new technologies to deal with. Ruby is a perfect match!</p>

<p>As you can guess, I can&#8217;t go into any detail about how and why Sony uses Ruby, but let me just say that while games are still usually written in C++, they are becoming more and more interactive and need to communicate with game servers where some logic operates. Game players also need to interact with other gamers as well as check their gaming progress online, as well as the progress of the players around them etc&#8230; Basically, outside of the game engine and the console SDK, there is a lot of potential for Ruby.</p>

<p>Coming back to Corporate America, I have to say that I&#8217;ve known my future manager for a few years now. He&#8217;s always been a fervent Ruby advocate and has introduced lots of teams to the happiness of Ruby &amp; Rails development. He&#8217;s also a great developer who&#8217;s contributing patches to major projects and has a bunch of cool stuff on github. To give you an idea, my job description mentions Rails, Merb, Sinatra, CouchdB, MongoDB, Redis, AWS. All these Ruby technologies are actually already used in production or are being seriously evaluated.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also really looking forward to join the existing team. I know I&#8217;m going to love working with a bunch of awesome developers coming from various backgrounds.</p>

<p>Those who know me, know that I&#8217;m not a morning person. And while your typical office job is categorized as &#8216;9-5&#8217;, don&#8217;t feel too bad for me. I will be joining the video game product department, and morning people are rather rare in these kinds of groups ;)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this opportunity. For me, it is proof again that the Ruby revolution took place and that the Enterprise is evolving. Of course, time will tell if I am right, but I am quite confident.</p>

<p>Also, Sony is always looking for new, talented people who want to push the entertainment world to the next level. Feel free to keep in touch with me if you are interested in joining the fun.</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2010/01/31/macruby-0-5-final-is-out/">MacRuby 0.5 Final Is Out</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>After going through two betas, MacRuby 0.5 final is now released and can be downloaded by clicking on the icon below:</p>

<p><a href="http://macruby.org/downloads.html"><img src="http://macruby.org/images/zip.png" alt="" />
MacRuby 0.5</a></p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about having MacRuby and Ruby 1.8.x or 1.9 installed, MacRuby is namespaced and won&#8217;t affect your current Ruby installations, just download and launch the installer. (Note: The build was compiled for SnowLeopard only)</p>

<p>You can read all the <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2010/01/31/macruby05.html">details of the release on the MacRuby website</a>.</p>

<p>So what changed since 0.4? Too many things for me to list them here but basically 0.5 uses LLVM to compile code and make MacRuby faster and integrate better with the Obj-c runtime. However since the last beta, here is what changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HotCocoa is now a separate gem</p></li>
<li><p>improved AOT compilation</p></li>
<li><p>Grand Central Dispatch support - use all your cores without the pain of threads. Read <a href="http://www.macruby.org/documentation/gcd.html">this post</a> for more info.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>0.5 is a solid release which I consider production ready, I personally wrote a few of small Cocoa apps in MacRuby and everything has been working very well. Of course, I&#8217;m also excited about the new stuff in 0.6 trunk like the debugger previewed a few weeks ago: <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/">http://merbist.com/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/</a> but also some drastic changes in the primitive classes that I might cover later on.</p>

<p>Finally, people are asking if the iPad will be able to run apps running in MacRuby. Unfortunately, the current answer is: no. The two issues with the IPhone/iP*d OS are the lack of Garbage Collector and support for BridgeSupport (needed to define CocoaTouch constants available from MacRuby). However, this matter is being discussed on the mailing list and progress is made by contributors (the core team primarily focusing on the desktop).</p>

<p>That is going to be an exciting Ruby week as MacRuby 0.5 is now out and Rails 3 beta/RC0 is expected really soon.</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/">How to Detect Cylons With MacRuby</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Over the weekend, MacRuby&#8217;s trunk became version 0.6 and the bug fixing is currently done in both the 0.5 branch and trunk. Based on MacRuby&#8217;s usual release cycle I would expect a 0.5 beta3 or 0.5 final to be released soon so most of the work can be focused on trunk.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll let you check on the <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/repository/ruby/MacRuby/trunk/TODO">TODO list</a> to see what was done in 0.5 and what is in the plan for 0.6.</p>

<p>However, there is one feature in 0.6 that I know lots of you will just love! The good news is that Laurent already committed a very early version of his work so I figured, I should share the good news with you:</p>

<h3>Introducing MacRuby&#8217;s debugger!</h3>

<p>If you were expecting to read: &#8220;a Cylon detector!&#8221;, keep on reading.</p>

<p>Again, this feature is in really early development since it&#8217;s scheduled for 0.6 and 0.5 final is not out yet. But if you install MacRuby using the <a href="http://macruby.icoretech.org/">nightly builds</a> or build from trunk, you can already play with the debugger.</p>

<p>Let me give you a really quick tour of the debugger.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100118-qn7yuq9h2ce61yxt6kwag9pnbt.jpg" alt="BSG75Logo posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s imagine that we were given the task to debug the cylon detector written by Gaius Baltar which looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>characters = %w{Adama Apollo Baltar Roslin StarBuck Six}

def cylon?(character)
  false
end

characters.each do |character|
  if cylon?(character)
    puts "#{character} is a Cylon!"
  else
    puts "#{character} is not a cylon."
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what happens when I execute the script:</p>

<pre><code>$ macruby cylon_detector.rb 
Adama is not a cylon.
Apollo is not a cylon.
Baltar is not a cylon.
Roslin is not a cylon.
StarBuck is not a cylon.
Six is not a cylon.
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem is that we all know that Six is a Cylon, the detector isn&#8217;t working right so let&#8217;s debug it:</p>

<pre><code>$ macrubyd cylon_detector.rb
Starting program.
cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; b cylon_detector.rb:8 if character == 'Six'
Added breakpoint 1.
cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; c
Adama is not a cylon.
Apollo is not a cylon.
Baltar is not a cylon.
Roslin is not a cylon.
StarBuck is not a cylon.
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; false
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p "This detector is broken!"
=&gt; "This detector is broken!"
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p def cylon?(character); character == 'Six'; end
=&gt; nil
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; true
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?('Matt')
=&gt; false
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; c
Six is a Cylon!
Program exited.
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we do is to add a conditional breakpoint:</p>

<pre><code>b cylon_detector.rb:8 if character == 'Six'
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the debugger will add a breakpoint at line 8 which will only be active when the value of &#8216;character&#8217; is equal to &#8216;Six&#8217;.
Now that the breakpoint added, we can continue the program execution and just wait until we reach the defined condition.</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; c
</code></pre>

<p>Once we reach the breakpoint, we evaluate the result of &#8220;cylon?(character)&#8221; by using the p command. We see that the result is &#8220;false&#8221; when we know for sure that it should be true since the value of the character variable is &#8216;Six&#8217; and she is a cylon. At this point, you might have guessed that somewhat acted as a cylon agent and I pretended to fix the problem by overwriting the &#8220;cylon?&#8221; method:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p def cylon?(character); character == 'Six'; end
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the method is overwritten, I can check that Six is recognized as being a cylon:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>and also check that I am not detected a cylon:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?('Matt')
=&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>I can now continue the execution of the program and see that Six is detected as a Cylon!</p>

<p>Of course this is just a very early version of the debugger and we will see lots of improvement in the next few weeks. Who knows someone might even create a GUI for the debugger and/or a Xcode integration.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point being that MacRuby developers should expect a lot of awesome stuff coming up their way soon. (also be careful about the skin jobs around you, cylon detectors can&#8217;t be trusted!)</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2010/01/17/controlling-itunes-with-macruby/">Controlling iTunes With MacRuby</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Since Mac OS X v10.5, Apple added a technology called Scripting Bridge which allows to control and communicate with scriptable applications such as Mail, iChat or iTunes.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/12/31/im-new-year-count-down-with-macruby/">I showed how to control iChat</a> with MacRuby. This time I&#8217;m going to show you how to control iTunes.</p>

<p>Here is a small script that I wrote to wake me up in music every morning.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/macruby
framework 'Foundation'
framework 'ScriptingBridge'

itunes = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier("com.apple.itunes")
load_bridge_support_file 'iTunes.bridgesupport'
itunes.run

class SBElementArray
  def [](value)
    self.objectWithName(value)
  end
end

itunes.stop
playlist = itunes.sources["Library"].userPlaylists["morning"]
playlist.playOnce(false) if playlist
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that I have a Mac Mini streaming music through speakers connected to an AirportExpress in my bedroom.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go through the script quickly.</p>

<p>We start by loading two frameworks, Foundation and ScriptingBridge.
Now that we have ScriptingBridge loaded, we can control iTunes. To do that, we use:
SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier(&#8220;com.apple.itunes&#8221;)
We then load a bridgesupport file that contains the enumerated constants from the iTunes scriptable dictionary.</p>

<p>We make sure iTunes is running by calling #run on the application object.</p>

<p>Before using iTune scriptable interface, we are making the API a bit nicer, it&#8217;s totally unnecessary but it makes our code look better.</p>

<p>itunes.sources returns an instance of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Reference/SBElementArray_Class/SBElementArray/SBElementArray.html">SBElementArray</a> which is not really an array nor a hash.</p>

<p>The rest of the code is pretty simple, we find the library, find the playlist called &#8216;morning&#8217; and play it if found.</p>

<p>So you might wonder two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the iTunes.bridgesupport file?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know what methods are available to control iTunes?</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>bridgesupport file</h4>

<p>The bridgesupport file is important since it defines the required constants.
Apple provides a metadata generator called gen_bridge_metadata which generates a bridgesupport file.</p>

<p>Here is what the documentation says:</p>

<pre><code>$ man gen_bridge_metadata




NAME
gen_bridge_metadata -- Objective-C Bridges Metadata Generator

SYNOPSIS
gen_bridge_metadata [options...] headers...

DESCRIPTION
gen_bridge_metadata is a tool that generates bridging metadata information for a given framework or set of head-
ers. The Objective-C bridges supported in Mac OS X, such as RubyCocoa (Ruby) and PyObjC (Python), read this
information at runtime.

Metadata files describe the parts of an Objective-C framework that the bridges cannot automatically handle. These
are primarily the ANSI C elements of the framework -- functions, constants, enumerations, and so on -- but also
include special cases such as functions or methods that accept pointer-like arguments. These special cases must
be manually specified in separate files called exceptions. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can then read in the
exceptions file when it generates the framework metadata.

The file extension used for metadata files should be .bridgesupport.

Certain elements, such as inline functions, cannot be described in the metadata files. It is therefore required
to generate a dynamic library in order to make the bridges use them. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can take care
of that for you.

The file extension for the dynamic libraries should be .dylib.

You should install metadata files in one of three filesystem locations. For example, for a framework named
MyFramework that is installed as /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework.framework, you can install the
MyFramework.bridgesupport and MyFramework.dylib files in one of the following possible locations, in order of
priority:

oÂ Â  /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework/Resources/BridgeSupport

oÂ Â  /Library/BridgeSupport

oÂ Â  ~/Library/BridgeSupport
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that we don&#8217;t have a framework or header file to generate a bridgesupport file for.
So, what we need a header file for iTunes, turns out we have a tool to do that:</p>

<pre><code>$ sdef /Applications/iTunes.app | sdp -fh --basename iTunes
</code></pre>

<p>I won&#8217;t go in the details of what sdef and sdp do, just check their manual page.
Running the command above will create a iTunes.h which we can use to create a bridgesupport file.
Here is the generated header file: http://gist.github.com/279657</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s create a bidgesupport file:</p>

<pre><code>$ gen_bridge_metadata -c '-I.' iTunes.h &gt; iTunes.bridgesupport
</code></pre>

<p>An that&#8217;s how we get the bridgesupport file. (see file: <a href="http://gist.github.com/279698">http://gist.github.com/279698</a>)</p>

<h4>iTunes Documentation</h4>

<p>The easiest way to understand what&#8217;s available to you is to open iTunes&#8217; dictionary in the AppleScript Editor.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100118-fe5c3224jd8xfhciwqxpy4hptc.jpg" alt="iTunes API by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>Otherwise you can study the iTunes.h file.</p>

<p>I wrote a very dumb parser to give you an idea of the methods and properties available when controlling iTunes via ScriptingBridge, here is theÂ  output:</p>
