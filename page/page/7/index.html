    <div class="entry">
        <p>The Ruby community is a well known for at least two things: <strong>being </strong><a href="http://pragprog.com/press_releases/the-passionate-programmer">passionate</a><strong> and being </strong><a href="http://www.bruisin-ales.com/beerblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/stoneintro.gif">arrogant</a> .
Two characteristics that often go together but I am not going to defend or justify anything in this post, instead I will try to reflect on my own experience and will share with you my own view point.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_wrong_coaster_2.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_wrong_coaster_2-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Very much like the Ruby community, I am also quite passionate and can be arrogant at times. A few months back I was in Brazil for <a href="http://www.railssummit.com.br/en/pages/home">RailsSummit</a> and I was chatting with <a href="http://twitter.com/dchelimsky">David Chelimsky</a> after a nice evening with the <a href="http://www.railssummit.com.br/en/pages/home">RailsSummit</a> attendees. I was thinking about how cool it was to have people from various non-Ruby communities to come to a Ruby community and share their experience and knowledge while observing the ways we do things with Ruby.</p>

<p>David and I got to talk about technical evangelism, how <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> became very popular, the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merb">Merb</a> vs <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> situation which turned into Rails3, as well as <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>. I was interested by the fact that I couldn&#8217;t remember David ever saying something bad about test/unit or trying to tell others they were doing it wrong. Instead, he has always tried showing why people might be potentially interested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec">RSpec</a>.</p>

<p>As an early RSpec adopter, I often thought that people were wrong not to use the solution that <em><strong>I</strong></em> thought was the best. As part of the Merb &#8216;propaganda&#8217;, we spent a lot of time comparing Merb with Rails and showing why Merb might be better for you and why you were doing it wrong if you would fit in Merb&#8217;s target and still use Rails.</p>

<p>Even before that, I remember thinking that if you were not using Ruby, you were doing it wrong. PHP &amp; Java developers were, for me, just developers who did not know any better (and I thought that Python-ers were just too lazy to learn a &#8220;better&#8221; language that takes OOP seriously ;)).</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_it_wrong_coaster.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_it_wrong_coaster-300x218.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Since then, things have changed. I have gotten involved with other projects, met different people and maybe, just maybe, matured a little bit. Going back to the discussion I had with David, he pointed out to me how often people talk about a piece of technology or an idea to just quickly conclude: <strong>&#8220;it sucks&#8221;</strong> and it has got even worse lately with the &#8217;<a href="http://www.doingitwrong.com/">you&#8217;re doing it wrong</a> &#8217; meme.</p>

<p>Basically, we judge people&#8217;s actions without knowing them or even having a clue about the problem they are facing and we just tell them that if they don&#8217;t do like us, they are wrong. If they are not using this plugin or this gem, they are doing it wrong, and if they are using this other one that sucks, they are also doing it wrong. Also, be careful, something that&#8217;s hot today will probably turn out to be &#8216;the suck&#8217; soon enough, keep up with what the cool kids tweet about ;)</p>

<p>But of course, this is something human and much bigger than the Ruby community. Look at the whole SQL/NoSQL <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1163039">pseudo fight</a> and you will notice the same attitude. Look at the editors war, look at the OS war or even look at the TV with shows like &#8217;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Marriage%20Ref">Marriage Ref</a>&#8217; making money off of people wanting to prove their partner that he/she is doing it wrong. But that&#8217;s also the root problem of most religion wars and even the motivation for some people to go &#8216;invade/colonize&#8217; other countries to eventually force their world vision upon them.</p>

<p>I realize the irony of writing of blog post to tell my readers that telling others that they are doing it wrong is, in itself, fundamental wrong, but maybe next time you think something sucks or is totally wrong, you might want to try to understand the motivation behind why some people decided to go this way. I know I will personally try harder.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>It is now official: I have traded my freedom &amp; home office for a job title, an Aeron chair in a cubicle and a 401K.</p>

<p>I received my new employee package and, in less than a week, I will officially become a full-time employee atÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_of_America"> SCEA</a> (Sony Computer Entertainment America).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to work in the PlayStation department, working on PS3, PS2 and PSP game titles developed by <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com/">various</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCE_Studio_San_Diego">game</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_Worldwide_Studios">studios</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sony_playstation_32.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sony_playstation_32-300x206.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h3>Why &#8216;o why?</h3>

<p><em>Why leave behind a happy life of indie contracting to join corporate America?</em></p>

<p>For many reasons actually:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Team</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Being a consultant I have been working with other independent consultants and existing teams. Nonetheless, I really miss being part of a stable team which grows together and learns from each other as we go through new projects and maintain old ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long term plan</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>As a consultant, I usually start projects or &#8220;rescue&#8221; existing projects. I work on them for a little while and then move on. It&#8217;s exciting and rewarding but you don&#8217;t really pay the consequences of your mistakes. You usually don&#8217;t have to maintain the code you wrote and you rarely deal with the mistakes <em>you</em> made.</p>

<p>It sounds good, nobody likes to maintain the crappy awesome code they wrote 2 years ago and most developers love working on new stuff. But at the same time, to become a better engineer you need to learn from you mistakes and assuming responsibility for your bad decisions is part of the process.</p>

<p>It might sound weird, but I&#8217;m actually excited to work on long term projects and feel some sort of ownership over the projects. Having to support games for many years means that I&#8217;d better not mess up the implementation. And if I do, I hope I&#8217;ll quickly learn from my mistakes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoiding burn out</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>There is no secret: when you are passionate about what you do, you have a hard time stopping and taking a break. I&#8217;m a recovering workaholic and it&#8217;s really hard for me to say no when I&#8217;m presented the possibility to work on interesting projects. I love what I do and I keep writing code even after I&#8217;m done with client work.</p>

<p>The problem is that this can start me on the slippery slope to isolating myself from friends, family and people who don&#8217;t share the same passion. I&#8217;m really lucky that my wife is a geek and loves hanging out at conferences, looking at code and playing with my buggy prototypes. But still, I spend too much time &#8220;playing&#8221; with my computer and I just can&#8217;t manage my free time wisely.</p>

<p>Having a full time position will hopefully help me put boundaries and will hopefully teach me to disconnect from work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exciting projects</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Hey, let&#8217;s be honest, how many geeks do you know don&#8217;t want to work in the video game industry? By the way, if you don&#8217;t have a PS3, they are now at $299 and on top of getting an awesome console you get a blue ray player! (And no, I do not receive any bonuses or commissions for mentioning the console or promoting it in my blog. I had to pay for my own like everyone else.)</p>

<h3>Corporate America? Are you going to write Java now?</h3>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/1264424156_24f4571b10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m mainly going to stick to the language I love: <strong>Ruby</strong>.
From time to time I will probably use other languages here and there, but that usually makes me love Ruby even more. The reality is that Ruby&#8217;s power and flexibility seem to be appreciated by SCEA, which makes sense when you have tight deadlines and a lot of new technologies to deal with. Ruby is a perfect match!</p>

<p>As you can guess, I can&#8217;t go into any detail about how and why Sony uses Ruby, but let me just say that while games are still usually written in C++, they are becoming more and more interactive and need to communicate with game servers where some logic operates. Game players also need to interact with other gamers as well as check their gaming progress online, as well as the progress of the players around them etc&#8230; Basically, outside of the game engine and the console SDK, there is a lot of potential for Ruby.</p>

<p>Coming back to Corporate America, I have to say that I&#8217;ve known my future manager for a few years now. He&#8217;s always been a fervent Ruby advocate and has introduced lots of teams to the happiness of Ruby &amp; Rails development. He&#8217;s also a great developer who&#8217;s contributing patches to major projects and has a bunch of cool stuff on github. To give you an idea, my job description mentions Rails, Merb, Sinatra, CouchdB, MongoDB, Redis, AWS. All these Ruby technologies are actually already used in production or are being seriously evaluated.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also really looking forward to join the existing team. I know I&#8217;m going to love working with a bunch of awesome developers coming from various backgrounds.</p>

<p>Those who know me, know that I&#8217;m not a morning person. And while your typical office job is categorized as &#8216;9-5&#8217;, don&#8217;t feel too bad for me. I will be joining the video game product department, and morning people are rather rare in these kinds of groups ;)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this opportunity. For me, it is proof again that the Ruby revolution took place and that the Enterprise is evolving. Of course, time will tell if I am right, but I am quite confident.</p>

<p>Also, Sony is always looking for new, talented people who want to push the entertainment world to the next level. Feel free to keep in touch with me if you are interested in joining the fun.</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2010/01/31/macruby-0-5-final-is-out/">MacRuby 0.5 Final Is Out</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>After going through two betas, MacRuby 0.5 final is now released and can be downloaded by clicking on the icon below:</p>

<p><a href="http://macruby.org/downloads.html"><img src="http://macruby.org/images/zip.png" alt="" />
MacRuby 0.5</a></p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about having MacRuby and Ruby 1.8.x or 1.9 installed, MacRuby is namespaced and won&#8217;t affect your current Ruby installations, just download and launch the installer. (Note: The build was compiled for SnowLeopard only)</p>

<p>You can read all the <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2010/01/31/macruby05.html">details of the release on the MacRuby website</a>.</p>

<p>So what changed since 0.4? Too many things for me to list them here but basically 0.5 uses LLVM to compile code and make MacRuby faster and integrate better with the Obj-c runtime. However since the last beta, here is what changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HotCocoa is now a separate gem</p></li>
<li><p>improved AOT compilation</p></li>
<li><p>Grand Central Dispatch support - use all your cores without the pain of threads. Read <a href="http://www.macruby.org/documentation/gcd.html">this post</a> for more info.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>0.5 is a solid release which I consider production ready, I personally wrote a few of small Cocoa apps in MacRuby and everything has been working very well. Of course, I&#8217;m also excited about the new stuff in 0.6 trunk like the debugger previewed a few weeks ago: <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/">http://merbist.com/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/</a> but also some drastic changes in the primitive classes that I might cover later on.</p>

<p>Finally, people are asking if the iPad will be able to run apps running in MacRuby. Unfortunately, the current answer is: no. The two issues with the IPhone/iP*d OS are the lack of Garbage Collector and support for BridgeSupport (needed to define CocoaTouch constants available from MacRuby). However, this matter is being discussed on the mailing list and progress is made by contributors (the core team primarily focusing on the desktop).</p>

<p>That is going to be an exciting Ruby week as MacRuby 0.5 is now out and Rails 3 beta/RC0 is expected really soon.</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/">How to Detect Cylons With MacRuby</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Over the weekend, MacRuby&#8217;s trunk became version 0.6 and the bug fixing is currently done in both the 0.5 branch and trunk. Based on MacRuby&#8217;s usual release cycle I would expect a 0.5 beta3 or 0.5 final to be released soon so most of the work can be focused on trunk.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll let you check on the <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/repository/ruby/MacRuby/trunk/TODO">TODO list</a> to see what was done in 0.5 and what is in the plan for 0.6.</p>

<p>However, there is one feature in 0.6 that I know lots of you will just love! The good news is that Laurent already committed a very early version of his work so I figured, I should share the good news with you:</p>

<h3>Introducing MacRuby&#8217;s debugger!</h3>

<p>If you were expecting to read: &#8220;a Cylon detector!&#8221;, keep on reading.</p>

<p>Again, this feature is in really early development since it&#8217;s scheduled for 0.6 and 0.5 final is not out yet. But if you install MacRuby using the <a href="http://macruby.icoretech.org/">nightly builds</a> or build from trunk, you can already play with the debugger.</p>

<p>Let me give you a really quick tour of the debugger.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100118-qn7yuq9h2ce61yxt6kwag9pnbt.jpg" alt="BSG75Logo posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s imagine that we were given the task to debug the cylon detector written by Gaius Baltar which looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>characters = %w{Adama Apollo Baltar Roslin StarBuck Six}

def cylon?(character)
  false
end

characters.each do |character|
  if cylon?(character)
    puts "#{character} is a Cylon!"
  else
    puts "#{character} is not a cylon."
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what happens when I execute the script:</p>

<pre><code>$ macruby cylon_detector.rb 
Adama is not a cylon.
Apollo is not a cylon.
Baltar is not a cylon.
Roslin is not a cylon.
StarBuck is not a cylon.
Six is not a cylon.
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem is that we all know that Six is a Cylon, the detector isn&#8217;t working right so let&#8217;s debug it:</p>

<pre><code>$ macrubyd cylon_detector.rb
Starting program.
cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; b cylon_detector.rb:8 if character == 'Six'
Added breakpoint 1.
cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; c
Adama is not a cylon.
Apollo is not a cylon.
Baltar is not a cylon.
Roslin is not a cylon.
StarBuck is not a cylon.
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; false
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p "This detector is broken!"
=&gt; "This detector is broken!"
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p def cylon?(character); character == 'Six'; end
=&gt; nil
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; true
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?('Matt')
=&gt; false
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; c
Six is a Cylon!
Program exited.
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we do is to add a conditional breakpoint:</p>

<pre><code>b cylon_detector.rb:8 if character == 'Six'
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the debugger will add a breakpoint at line 8 which will only be active when the value of &#8216;character&#8217; is equal to &#8216;Six&#8217;.
Now that the breakpoint added, we can continue the program execution and just wait until we reach the defined condition.</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; c
</code></pre>

<p>Once we reach the breakpoint, we evaluate the result of &#8220;cylon?(character)&#8221; by using the p command. We see that the result is &#8220;false&#8221; when we know for sure that it should be true since the value of the character variable is &#8216;Six&#8217; and she is a cylon. At this point, you might have guessed that somewhat acted as a cylon agent and I pretended to fix the problem by overwriting the &#8220;cylon?&#8221; method:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p def cylon?(character); character == 'Six'; end
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the method is overwritten, I can check that Six is recognized as being a cylon:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>and also check that I am not detected a cylon:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?('Matt')
=&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>I can now continue the execution of the program and see that Six is detected as a Cylon!</p>

<p>Of course this is just a very early version of the debugger and we will see lots of improvement in the next few weeks. Who knows someone might even create a GUI for the debugger and/or a Xcode integration.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point being that MacRuby developers should expect a lot of awesome stuff coming up their way soon. (also be careful about the skin jobs around you, cylon detectors can&#8217;t be trusted!)</p>
