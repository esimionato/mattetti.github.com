<h2>Quality time with Matz</h2>

<p>The day after Ruby Conf, <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> and myself (Matt Aimonetti) were hanging out in the lobby of the hotel. <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/obie/3036221023/">Rein</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/obie/3036211957/">Desi</a>, and others were hacking away/chilling. Matz was also there networking before taking off for the airport.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_273&#8221; align=&#8221;alignleft&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;wycats, matz, mattetti&#8221;]<img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/katz_matz_mattetti-300x149.jpg" alt="wycats, matz, mattetti" />[/caption]</p>

<p>Matz and I started talking about the fact that unlike what most people believe, Ruby for the web is fast, way faster than any PHP solution. We looked at different benchmarks, discussed the philosophical differences between Merb and Rails, his own view of web development and how Ruby was perceived in Japan. Yehuda joined us and we started talking about Ruby 1.9.</p>

<p>Koichi had a great presentation abou<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notheory/3037535342/in/photostream"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3046/3037535342_d35680909d_m.jpg" alt="" /></a>t YARV few days before and we spent few hours chatting with the JRuby guys and Laurent Sansonetti from MacRuby. We had some concerns about Ruby 1.9, Matz also asked us about Ruby 1.8.7. It was great to get a direct feedback about what&#8217;s going on in the Ruby team, their schedule, process etc&#8230; We also realized that we (the Merb team) need to communicate better with the Ruby team when we need something added the language. It was also very interesting to hear Matz&#8217; opinion on Ruby Enterprise Edition.Â  As everybody knows Matz is a nice guy and that&#8217;s why Ruby people should be nice :)Â  I have to agree, Matz is a very kind and patient person.</p>

<h2>Hack time with Aaron Patterson and Bryan Helmkamp</h2>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignleft&#8221; width=&#8221;240&#8221; caption=&#8221;Yehuda (Merb), Charles (JRuby) and Laurent (MacRuby)&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notheory/3037534604/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3051/3037534604_fe74986020_m.jpg" alt="Yehuda (Merb), Charles(JRuby) and Laurent(MacRuby)" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>One of the reasons why RubyConf was awesome is that every other guy was the author/maintainer of a major Ruby library. As you know Merb plays well with a lot of various libraries and having some time to seat down with the maintenairs of these libraries make things way easier.</p>

<p><a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2008/10/30/nokogiri-is-released/">Nokogiri</a> As already mentioned, we switched to nokogiri before 1.0. Nokogiri is based on libxml2 which is a fast and reliable XML parser. I won&#8217;t get into the hpricot vs nokogiri argument, but let&#8217;s just say that nokogiri was fitting our needs better. (Nokogiri is only used in the specs, and therefore is not needed to run Merb)</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;240&#8221; caption=&#8221;David Chelimsky (RSpec), Matt Aimonetti (Merb)&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notheory/3036694117/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/3036694117_13b53141d7_m.jpg" alt="David Chelimsky(RSpec), Matt Aimonetti(Merb)" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master">Webrat</a> is an awesome library that let you test your app by using a virtual browser or by integrating with <a href="http://selenium.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>. Webrat also switched to Nokogiri and we moved some of our matchers directly to webrat since webrat became a Merb development dependency. Thanks to webrat you can write tests that will fill up forms, follow links, select options&#8230; basically act as a user. What&#8217;s even better is that you can run these test directly in your browser thanks to Selenium!Â  Because we think Webrat is totally awesome, we decided to offer framework support so people wanting to use webrat functionalities could do it without struggling, it there out of the box.</p>

<p>I have to say that both Bryan and Aaron are great guys, even though they both had their girlfriends with them, they spent time with us working out some details and discussion options. Thanks a lot guys!</p>

<p>(p.s: both projects also work great with Rails)</p>

<h2>Merb presentation at ORUG</h2>

<p><a href="http://orug.org">Orlando Ruby Group</a> meets once a month and this month I was invited to talk about Merb. Just before me, Thomas Meeks gave a great talk on Nanite. It was really nice to meet a lot of the local Merbists. Most of them went to RubyConf, but I didn&#8217;t get to meet everyone, so it was great to a sescond chance to network.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/merb-presentation-at-orug-presentation">My slides are available on slideshare.net</a> You might be interested in looking at the different Merb app formats (very_flat, flat, core and stack) examples starting slide 45.</p>

<h2>RailsCamp Australia</h2>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_275&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;150&#8221; caption=&#8221;Daniel giving a talk on Merb&#8221;]<img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hassox-railscamp1-150x150.jpg" alt="Daniel giving a talk on Merb" />[/caption]</p>

<p><a href="http://railscamp08.org">RailsCamp</a> Australia took place in Adelaide this year. Of course our Australian core team member couldn&#8217;t miss the event. Daniel Neighman aka hassox, the man being merb-auth made it to the event and talked about Merb. (RailsCamp is more of a RubyCamp than a Rails conf so nobody really complained, hassox got a lot of good feedbacks)</p>

<h2>Rails Podcast</h2>

<p><a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>, one of the first merbists and very well known figure of the Ruby/Rails community <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/rubyconf-2008">recorded a podcast</a> during RubyConf. Geoffrey interviewed me about Merb 1.0 as well as Blake from <a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a> and josh Peek from <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>.</p>

<h2>Rails vs Merb drama</h2>

<p>I already explained the whole story in <a href="http://merbist.com/2008/11/15/rails-vs-merb-drama/">a previous post</a>. It seems that Yehuda and David agree on something: <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/16/mythbusting-we-agree-ruby-is-awesome/">Ruby is awesome</a>. <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David</a> is still ignoring Merb, but is answering indirectly via an interesting series of <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/29-the-rails-myths">Rails Myths</a>. Over on Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/adzap/statuses/1007999209">adzap suggests</a> that Yehuda was just following DHH advise, and was trying to create a conflict because, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/conflict_is_good_for_business.php">according to 37signals conflict is good for business</a>. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what Yehuda had in mind when he replied to Jeremy, but that would explain why DHH ignores <em>(Â¿on purprose?)</em> the Merb community.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Since 1.0 is out, our main focus has been documentation. However we can&#8217;t write all the documentation ourselves. So we focused on helping people on IRC/Mailing list so they can help us with the documentation. The Japanese merbists started their own wiki, the Chinese, French and Japanese merbists started their own mailing list. <a href="http://jijixi.azito.com/cgi-bin/diary/index.rb?date=20081112">Here is an example</a> of Japanese thread covering some of Merb basics.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com">wiki</a> is also growing, I personally added a glossary to the &#8221;<a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/faq_converting_a_rails_app_to_merb">Rails to Merb guide</a>&#8221;. Showing you the Merb equivalent of some of Rails idioms. I also posted a <a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/example_apps/simple_app">merb example app</a> with sources available on <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/simple_merb_example_app/tree/master">github</a>.Â  While this is not a full app, the example covers:</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>generating an application</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>generating a resource</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>specing/testing a model</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>adding model validation</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>specing/testing requests</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>modifying views and layouts</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>passing flash messages (messages passed from one action to another)</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>adding authenticated routes</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>testing authenticated requests</p>

<p>Feel free to fork the project, add more branches (one step per branch please, so people can look at the diffs) etc&#8230;</p>

<p>My goal in writing this example was to show people the basics to get started and especilly how to test a merb app. Note that this is NOT the only way, but I feel strong about TDD and by providing you with simple examples you might also give it a try ;)</p>

<p>My next victim will be a Merb slice, I&#8217;ll show you how to easily write and test a Merb slice to use, reuse and abuse your code.</p>

<p><a href="http://peepcode.com"><img src="http://peepcode.com/images/logo/peepcode.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Peepcode released <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/meet-merb-pdf-draft">an updated PDF covering Merb 1.0</a></p>

<p>I saw the draft of the upcoming Merb screencast, and once again, Geoffrey does an awesome job teaching you what you need to know.</p>

<p>(p.s: this blog is not sponsored by peepcode ;) )</p>

<p><a href="http://www.manning.com/ivey/"><img src="http://www.manning.com/ivey/ivey_cover150.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.manning.com/ivey/">Yehuda&#8217;s beta book on Merb</a> also got updated to cover Merb 1.0.</p>

<p>The first chapter is available <a href="http://www.manning.com/ivey/katz_meapch1.pdf">for free</a>, the 3 other available chapters cover:</p>

<p>Getting started With Merb
Using Merb with a database
Automated testing</p>

<p>Since it&#8217;s a beta book, you receive update/new chapters automatically.</p>

<p>(print version available later on)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2008/08/announcing-the-merb-way-by-foy-savas.html"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/merb_way_cover-150x150.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Merb contributor,<a href="http://foysavas.com"> Foy Savas</a> told me he made a lot of progress on his book and he hopes to have a PDF version out before the end of the year.</p>

<p>You can meet Foy in person in Boston on November 17-20 at the Addison-Wesley <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Voices that Matter: Professional Ruby Conference</a>.</p>

<p>(I can&#8217;t remember who is writing the third book on Merb, please contact me so I can update this section)</p>

<p>I also noticed a bunch of guys on IRC writing plugins and slices, I hope to see even more tutorials very soon.</p>

<h2>Merb 1.0.1</h2>

<p>Merb 1.0.1 is in the work and should be released in the next few days. It&#8217;s just a maintenance release, so nothing new but we expect to ship with the new upcoming version of DataMapper, optimized generator (you will be able to use spaces in between arguments if you follow the unix standard) and some bug fixes.</p>

<h2>Qcon</h2>

<p><a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2008/speaker/Gregg+Pollack"><img src="http://www.infoq.com/styles/i/logo.gif" alt="" />Gregg Pollack</a> from the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/">RailsEnvy hall of fame</a>, is organizing a Ruby track during <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2008/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=172">Qcon</a>, the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">infoQ</a> conference taking place in SanFrancisco this week. Both Yehuda and I are scheduled to talk. My talk is on Merb for the Enterprise and Yehuda&#8217;s is on testing. If you are around, come say hi.</p>

        <p>That&#8217;s official, according to Twitter the fight has started.</p>

<p>In this corner, weighing in at XXX LOC, from 37signals in the white trunks: <strong>Rails</strong> and in this other corner,Â  weighing in at YYY LOC from Engine Yard: <strong>Merb</strong>!</p>

<p>I wish I had a more aggressive photo of Yehuda, but oh well&#8230;</p>

<p>So people love drama, from American Idol to the Elections without forgetting Survivor, Heroes and other TV shows. Few weeks ago there was a tentative from Giles to create some controversy but he did not really work so well. The last big drama we had in the Ruby community was Zed and his infamous blog post&#8230;</p>

<h2>The plot</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, in a world where .NET, JAVA and PHP were ruling the internet development world, a not so well known programming language was getting more and more traction in the far east. Ruby, as it was known in Japan, only had very little documentation in English and real ninjas had to translate docs from <em>obscure</em> Japanese writings in order to become enlightened. Nevertheless, a courageous Danish student named David decided to build an application called <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">basecamp</a> using this &#8220;exotic&#8221; language. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson">David</a> decided to extract a framework from his work for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37_signals">37signals</a>. He called his framework &#8221;<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>&#8221; and offered it to the world under the MIT license. Pretty quickly, as <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> was getting more popular in the West, people looked at &#8220;Rails&#8221; and loved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC architecture</a>, the conventions over configuration, testing framework and especially the language: <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>As Rails was getting popular, a man from Polish descent known as <a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> and who was working for <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> got frustrated with some of Rails limitations. He needed something simpler, easier and faster. In fact he just needed a Mongrel handler, a way to process a request really quickly without going through then entire stack and without slowing down the main app. That&#8217;s how Ezra started <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s fast forward 2 years. The year is 2008, the place is Orlando, Florida. <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a>, Merb&#8217;s lead developer announces the 1.0 release of a Ruby web framework started 2 years earlier by Ezra. The framework&#8217;s selling points are: performance, modularilty, flexibilty.Â  In the mean time other Ruby frameworks were developed such as <a href="https://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/">camping</a>, <a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a>, <a href="http://www.mackframework.com/">mack</a>, <a href="http://rubywaves.com/">waves</a>&#8230;</p>

<h2>The plot twist</h2>

<p>Now that Merb 1.0 is out, some people want to know what they should use for their next project. Merb or Rails? What&#8217;s the difference, after all they seem to be doing the same thing. Someone starts a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/7d5u6/so_why_should_i_choose_merb_over_ruby_on_rails/">Reddit thread</a> asking this very same question to the community&#8230;. and the drama begins!</p>

<p>Someone mentions that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/7d5u6/so_why_should_i_choose_merb_over_ruby_on_rails/c06ckgv">Merb has less code so it&#8217;s easier to understand</a> the &#8220;underpinnings of your framework&#8221;. <a href="http://bitsweat.net/">Jeremy Kemper aka Bitsweat</a> from Rails core team reply by saying that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/bitsweat/">Rails code base is only 1/4 bigger than Merb&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>part 2:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Yehuda Katz, jumps to his shell, runs some commands and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/7d5u6/so_why_should_i_choose_merb_over_ruby_on_rails/c06d0f3">replies that Jeremy</a> did not count right and really, Merb is half the code size has Rails. He even writes a <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/14/mythbusting-merb-style/">blog post to explain what he did</a> his main point being that Merb can run on subset of his code (merb-core) while Rails can&#8217;t.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>part 3:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>At this point, DHH already <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/29-the-rails-myths">started addressing</a> some of the reproaches the Merb community has brought on Rails. Interesting enough, DHH carefully never mentions Merb though. However just after wycats/Yehuda&#8217;s post, DHH releases a post entitled: <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/33-myth-4-rails-is-a-monolith">Rails is a monolith</a>. In his post, DHH calls LOC comparison an &#8220;inverse dick measurement match&#8221;. He goes even further and gives the size of some of Rails&#8217; components, mentions that there is a way in Rails to remove parts you don&#8217;t want but that anyway &#8220;Why would you bother? And that&#8217;s an answer I [DHH] don&#8217;t quite have for you.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>part 4 (I told you it was a real drama)</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Yehuda considers that even though, DHH didn&#8217;t mention him or Merb, &#8220;they&#8221; means the Merb community. Unfortunately, DHH doesn&#8217;t allow comments on his site so Yehuda decides to write yet <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/15/mythbusting-rails-is-not-a-monolith/">another blog post</a>. In his post, Yehuda deconstructs DHH arguments and tries to explain the philosphical difference between the two frameworks.</p>

<h2>Drama or no drama?</h2>

<p>There were a lot of comments on reddit and yehuda&#8217;s blog, a lot of tweets were sent, Â but is there a real drama?</p>

<p>My answer is <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p>The truth is that Merb was developed because some people like Ezra, Yehuda, myself and others were frustrated by some aspects of the Rails framework. We believed in the framework main concept but we were not sharing some of the core values or some of the details of the implementation.</p>

<p>We have nothing but respect for DHH and the Rails core team.<strong> To be honest, without Matz and without DHH, I wouldn&#8217;t do the job I do today and my job would probably not be as much as what it is</strong>. Most, if not all of the Merb core team members contributed to Rails and are very familiar with its architecture. We just have a different philosophy/approach of problems.</p>

<p>There is also a lot of collaboration between the two teams. Ezra brought rack to Rails, Merb pushed rails to become thread-safe, during RubyConf, <a href="http://joshpeek.com/">Josh Peek</a> mentioned <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/rubyconf-2008">porting run_later</a> (a Merb only feature) to Rails now that it&#8217;s thread safe. On the other end, we based a lot of our framework on concepts proven by Rails.</p>

<p><strong>So what is it all about?</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s just people arguing ideas. It&#8217;s actually a very healthy thing for a community to do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not oviously talking about the Rails overall community. I do realize it might shake the Rails community a little bit, but I think it&#8217;s for the best.</p>

<p>I also hope Sinatra, Waves, camping will join the debate. Sinatra for example is an awesome tiny framework. Merb has flat/very-flat structures which do something similar to Sinatra but with some differences. I think it&#8217;s great we can talk freely about the philosophies behind each framework.</p>

<p>By putting arguments out there and arguing ideas without fighting, I strongly believe that each framework will just become better and it would be easier for developers to choose what framework fits their needs best.</p>

<p><strong>No drama then?</strong></p>

<p>Well, maybe a little bit, let me quote a quote from <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Have_an_Enemy.php">37signals book, getting real</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Don&#8217;t follow the leader</strong>
Marketers (and all human beings) are well trained to follow the leader. The natural instinct is to figure out what&#8217;s working for the competition and then try to outdo it â€” to be cheaper than your competitor who competes on price, or faster than the competitor who competes on speed. The problem is that once a consumer has bought someone else&#8217;s story and believes that lie, <strong>persuading the consumer to switch is the same as persuading him to admit he was wrong</strong>. And people hate admitting that they&#8217;re wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>â€”<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, author/entrepreneur (from <a href="http://www.moveahead1.com/articles/article_details.asp?id=33">Be a Better Liar</a>)</p>

<p>Godin makes a good point, some people feel threatened by a new solution competing with the one they currently use. Godin and 37 signals suggest that instead of competing on the same ground as the leader (in this case Rails), you should position yourself differently and that&#8217;s what Merb has been doing since theÂ beginning.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s probably why Yehuda reacted when Jeremy and David said that basically, Merb was no different than Rails.</p>

<p>Merb&#8217;s point is not to be a faster Rails, instead Merb brings a different approach to the Ruby web development world. And that&#8217;s the true identity of Merb.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>No need for trolling or making a big deal about what happened. Rails and Merb are both lead by opinionated/passionate people who have a different view on what their framework should do and how it should do it. Â Let&#8217;s keep the dialogue open but let&#8217;s not forget that all of us spend hours and hours offering software and the goal is to server the community no to fight.</p>

<p>Both Rails and Merb have pros and cons, learn more about the difference between the two frameworks, look at other solutions and more importantly evaluate your needs.</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2008/11/14/merb-10-tips-part-1/">Merb 1.0 - Tips Part 1</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Â </p>

<p>As you must know by now, last week,<a href="http://merbist.com/2008/11/09/merb-1-0-released"> Merb 1.0 got released</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nsa_logo.gif"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nsa_logo.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Because we wanted to assure the release was fine, we asked <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>, <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> and <a href="http://yellowpages.com">YellowPages.com</a> to help us by hiring the NSA to monitor Merb users. After all, we need to know what people complain about so we can fix it ASAP.</p>

<p>Turns out all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON">echelon monitoring sites</a> were already busy. So we had to go back to good old IRC and <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=merb">twitter search</a> ;)</p>

<p>The release looks pretty solid, thanks to all the people reported bugs during the release candidate cycle. Thanks guys!</p>

<p>However there are still few points of confusion I&#8217;d like to address.</p>

<h2>How do I require/request/load a plugin?</h2>

<p>I saw this question few times on IRC and someone after my <a href="http://orug.org">ORUG</a> merb presentation tonight asked me exactly the same thing. I promised <a href="http://peepcode.com/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> that I would update the RDoc but in the meantime here is quick explanation.</p>

<p>You should almost never use the require method to load a gem. Rubygems has a method called gem that takes a version as an argument:</p>

<p><code>require "rubygems"
gem "merb-core", "~&gt; 1.0"
</code></p>

<p>Using gem you can specify a version of the gem you want to load. Therefore you avoid loading an unexpected version of a gem. A few tricks to know (for regular Ruby code; keep reading for the Merb technique):</p>

<p>You can use &#8220;=1.0&#8221; to limit to version 1.0, or &#8220;>= 1.0&#8221; to load 1.0 and anything newer. My favorite trick is to use &#8220;~> 1.0&#8221; which means load latest version between 1.0 and 2.0</p>

<p>However when using Merb you don&#8217;t want to load gems just whenever. Merb&#8217;s bootup process starts by setting up the directory structure, and you typically want to load plugins after this point. To make this transparent to you, we have the #dependency method. The dependency method uses the gem method internally to load specific versions at the right time. Additionally, we may use it in the future to improve Merb&#8217;s built-in bundling or dependency resolution. As a result, you should always use the dependency method, and not try to use require directly for Merb plugins.</p>

<p>It also comes with two tricks you should know about. Let&#8217;s say you want to require a gem from github:</p>

<p><code>dependency "mattetti-awesomeâ€, "~&gt;1.0", :require_as =&gt; â€œawesomeâ€
</code></p>

<p>The example above is the same as:
<code>
gem "mattetti-awesome", "~1.0"
require "awesome"
</code>
Apart that it gets loaded when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>

<p>You can also pass a block after your dependency call:</p>

<p><code>dependency('jchris-couchrest', "&gt;= 0.5", :require_as =&gt; "couchrest") do
Â Â require "lib/custom_hack.rb"
endÂ </code></p>

<p>The block will be executed after the gem is loaded and required. Use a block if you want to perform some action after the dependency is loaded.</p>

<p>Finally the last trick lets you load a gem right when you declare the dependency:</p>

<p><code>dependency "nokogiriâ€, "~&gt;0.5", :immediate =&gt; true</code></p>

<h2>I have issues with merb -i and can&#8217;t run the specs</h2>

<p>Few things here, first off, Merb forces you to use rubygems 1.3 because 1.2 is very buggy and the Rubygems maintainer suggested we do so. Rubygems let you define development-only dependencies, dependencies you don&#8217;t need to have to run your library in production. These dependencies were designed to be used when developing a library, but in the case of Merb, they are used to define dependencies that you only need at development-time, but not in production.</p>

<p>In our case we defined webrat as a development dependency. That means you need Webrat to run your specs, but won&#8217;t need it in production. Now here is something you should know, whenever you install a gem to develop it, you should use:</p>

<p><code>gem install "merb-core" --development
</code></p>

<p>The &#8211;development flag will install all the dev dependencies declared by the gem.  Now merb -i loads the code needed to make the request object available in the console, the problem is that this code also loads some test helpers which require webrat. We have a ticket open for that and will get to that soon.</p>

<p>In the mean time, make sure you have webrat and nokogiri installed. (Nokogiri requires you have a somehow recent version of libxml2, which comes with OSX, but not all Linux distributions).</p>

<p>People reported some issues updating rubygems, Robby Colvin wrote a <a href="http://robbycolvin.com/archives/merbrubygems-upgrade-errors/">nice article</a> explaining how to get pass this issue.</p>

<h2>Issues with action-args not loading</h2>

<p>Some people reported issues with loading action-args. Turns out it&#8217;s some sort of weird issue with hoe (the library) and a some of action-args deps. If that happens to you, update hoe:<code>
</code></p>

<p><code>$ sudo gem install hoe
</code></p>

<h2>I generated an app and it doesn&#8217;t work with JRuby</h2>

<p>If you generate a merb using merb-gen app my-app-name it generates a merb stack app. It&#8217;s an opinionated bundle with everything you might need including jQuery, DataMapper and a bunch of plugins. The problem is that DataMapper doesn&#8217;t run on JRuby yet so it won&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Instead you should generate a core application:</p>

<p><code>merb-gen core app-name</code></p>

<p>This way you create a blank app with no dependencies. Then add what you need. <a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/faqs/merb_components">Here is a list of dependencies</a> for a merb stack app and what they do.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Finally I would like to thank the Ruby community from Japan. First because many people came to RubyConf all the way from Japan. I&#8217;m personally sorry I couldn&#8217;t meet you all. Thankfully some people started a new chat channel on lingr: <a href="http://www.lingr.com/room/merb.jp">merb.jp</a> and I could meet more Japanese Merbists. Because the Merb team thinks is important that Merb is being used outside of the English speaking world and because we need feedback from other countries, I decided to make the trip to RubyKaigi 2009. Hopefully we will be able to have some talks about Merb :)Â  I would also want to thank Erubis author, Makoto Kuwata for translating the<a href="http://merbist.com/2008/11/09/merb-1-0-released"> Merb 1.0 annoucement post</a> in Japanese.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>Here are the slides from my talk at <a href="http://orug.org">Orug</a>, a quick presentation of Merb. I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2008/conference/">QCon</a> next week to talk about <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2008/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=172">Ruby for the Enterprise</a>. Thanks <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Gregg</a> for thinking of me!</p>

        <p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/absolutely_loverly/120000855/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/47/120000855_c7d39781f7_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kwatch/20081112/1226448192"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nihon-japan-48.png" alt="" /></a>
<a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kwatch/20081112/1226448192">Japanese translation</a></p>

<p>On November 7, <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/">Yehuda Katz</a> gave a talk at <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> and made 3 major announcements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a> to offer <a href="http://engineyard.com/merbsupport">Merb support</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ma-agile.com/">m|a agile</a> to offer <a href="http://ma-agile.com/training/">professional training</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb 1.0 released!</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The first announcement is pretty substantial. <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a> has been financially supporting <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb</a> by letting some of their staff work on Merb, fly them to different conferences and sponsoring events like <a href="http://merbcamp.com">Merb Camp</a>. Engine Yard didn&#8217;t yet announce the price structure but <strong>having the option for enterprise level support for Merb is just awesome</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://railstips.org">John Nunemaker</a> made an interesting comment during RubyConf <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal</a> Party. Something special about Merb is that it was designed to fit the needs of an audience instead of trying to create a series of tools to build a specific type of website. Having Engine Yard help to finance Merb dev and offer support is very reassuring. It&#8217;s something already done by many other OSS projects such as Ubuntu, MySQL etc&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://ma-agile.com/training"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/merb-training-small-238x300.gif" alt="" /></a>The second announcement Yehuda made was about <a href="http://ma-agile.com/training/">Merb Training</a>. I&#8217;m probably pretty biased since I am at the origin of this project. I know for a fact that a lot of people were waiting for 1.0 to get started with Merb. We are also working on getting more documentation out, and 3 books are coming up. Still, the best way to learn is to sit down with people who know Merb who can teach you the way its intended to be used.</p>

<p>Training will allow you to benefit a lot from being with other people who also share the same desire to <strong>master Ruby&#8217;s most powerful and flexible web framework</strong>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s also really exciting is that <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a>, Merb&#8217;s lead developer, agreed to be a tutor for the course. I can&#8217;t imagine a better way to learn. Check <a href="http://ma-agile.com/training/">this page</a> for more information about the next training session or get in contact with me if you want to organize a training session for your company.</p>

<h3>Finally, the <strong>big news was the announcement of Merb 1.0</strong>!</h3>

<p>Merb 1.0 went through 5 release candidates and was finally marked as final. In the last few months, the Merb team worked hard to make things easier for people who want to get started in no time.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s quickly look at why Merb is awesome:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Merb is Modular</strong>. Merb is not a monolithic framework. You can pick and choose what you need. Create a 1 file app &#8220;Ã  la Sinatra&#8221; or a rich web app &#8220;Ã  la Rails&#8221;. Merb has many components. Only requires the ones you need and save precious resources. (Merb doesn&#8217;t believe in 1 size fits all)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb is agnostic</strong> (kinda). Because people have different needs and different believes, Merb won&#8217;t force you to use one ORM or another. Same thing goes for the template engine or for the JavaScript library you want to use. ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Sequel, RelaxDb, Haml, Erb, Prototype, jQuery&#8230; choose which one you want and change whenever you want.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb <em>can</em> be opinionated</strong>. Merb offers a default stack using DataMapper and jQuery, authentication, exceptions and caching setup for you. However, creating your own stack is dead easy. As a matter of fact, the guys at <a href="http://yellowpages.com">yellowpages.com</a> are using Merb and were talking about creating their own stack using Sequel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb let you reuse your code</strong>. Borrowed from <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, Merb has something called &#8220;slices&#8221;. Slices are mini apps you can run standalone or mounted within another app. A slice is a great way to write code you can reuse. Unlike plugins which extend the framework features, slices are a way to provide encapsulated content. (<a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/">David Chelimsky,</a> RSpec&#8217;s author and maintainer actually said that slices where his favorite feature in Merb 1.0)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb has an API</strong>. You might be wondering why having an API is awesome. Well, the truth is that the Merb Team spent time marking methods public, which are guaranteed to not break until the next major release (any change to the public API will be well documented). There is also a plugin API meaning that plugin developers won&#8217;t have to worry about upgrades if they stick to the plugin API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb is fast.</strong> Even though Ruby the language isn&#8217;t really fast and contrary to popular opinion, Ruby for the web is one of the fastest solutions out there. (Even Rails is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/wycats/merb-camp-keynote-presentation">way faster than all the mainstream PHP frameworks</a>) And that&#8217;s what Merb is proving by being one of the fastest web framework available on the market. <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Jason Seifer</a> will be interested to know that Merb isn&#8217;t scared to scale ;) As a matter of fact, Merb is going to scale even better in the next few months as we are planning to integrate <a href="http://swiftiply.swiftcore.org/index.html">Swiftiply</a> and do some totally awesome stuff to spawn/reap workers based load. (more about that in few weeks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matz likes Merb</strong>. Ruby&#8217;s daddy, Yukihiro Matsumoto told us he likes the flexibility of Merb and the fact that the framework doesn&#8217;t create a DSL on top of Ruby. He even told us that he&#8217;s going to introduce his company to Merb! We were obviously very honored and for us, it validates months of work by dozens of contributors. Here is a transcript of Matz comments about Merb and the Ruby web world:</p></li>
</ul>


<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_213&#8221; align=&#8221;alignleft&#8221; width=&#8221;125&#8221; caption=&#8221;Yukihiro Matsumoto aka Matz&#8221;]<a href="http://ruby-lang.org"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yukihiro_matsumoto_125px.jpg" alt="Yukihiro Matsumoto aka Matz" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone outside of the Ruby community understands that we only have 1 web application framework, named Rails, but it&#8217;s not true in any sense. We have several post-Rails frameworks, which is very good, and I believe in diversity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Merb has a bright future for the people who are not satisfied by the fixed ways in Rails.Â  I think that Merb will give users more freedom in a Ruby-ish way of programming.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not really a web-guy, so i don&#8217;t judge any of them [frameworks], but Rails does some kind of drastic change on the language itself like in Active Support.Â  But Ruby has its own culture and technological atmosphere in the language so that keeping that makes me feel easier.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Merb is memory friendly and therefore cheap</strong>. Merb is Open Source and free, but hosting an application costs money. Merb memory footprint is tiny compared to other solutions and that means that hosting will cost you less. (interesting when you think that EngineYard help developing Merb :p) Using <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Entreprise Edition</a>, you will even use less memory, meaning you save even more money ;) By the way, Matz told me this morning that the Ruby core team is working on their own solution for a better GC and it should be available soon. (Ruby 1.9.x)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merb source code is easy to read</strong>. Because <a href="http://github.com/wycats/merb/tree/master">Merb code</a> is modular and because Merb has a concept of an API, reading Merb&#8217;s source code is pretty easy. On top of that, Merb itself uses RSpec making tests really easy to read and understand.Â  What&#8217;s great when the source code is easy to read is that developers can quickly check the source code if they want to understand how things work. We also get better patches from contributors and we keep our code clean. We believe in the theory of the &#8220;Broken Windows&#8221; by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>&#8220;Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it&#8217;s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or consider a sidewalk. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of trash from take-out restaurants there or breaking into cars.&#8221;</p>

<p>I guess I could keep on going with other reasons why Merb is so awesome, but let&#8217;s keep some for another post ;)</p>

<p>In conclusion, on behalf of the Merb core team, I&#8217;d like to thank all the Merb contributors, Ezra Zygmuntowic (creator of Merb), Yehuda Katz (Merb lead developer), Matz (Ruby creator) and finally DHH &amp; the Rails core team. One more thing:</p>

$ sudo gem install merb
$ merb-gen app my-awesome-merb-app
</code></p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2008/11/03/merb-10-rc5/">Merb 1.0 RC5</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>As you might have noticed, we&#8217;ve been pushing a lot of Release Candidates out the door. The reason is that we want to make sure 1.0 is really ready for showtime!</p>

<p>We are also getting a lot of bug reports that help us focusing on the main issues. Today RC5 was pushed to a RubyForge mirror close to you and <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/03/merb-rc5-final-rc/">here is a report from Yehuda Katz</a>, <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb</a> lead developer.</p>

<p>This is the final RC before we ship 1.0 final at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a>. Here is a really quick rundown of the bugfixes and improvement added to this release:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master">Webrat</a> integration out of the box. (<a href="http://github.com/wycats/merb/tree/master/merb-core/spec/public/webrat/webrat_spec.rb">see example</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Improved Merb bundling</p></li>
<li><p>spec view helpers now use <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2008/10/30/nokogiri-is-released/">nokogiri</a> (with rexml as fallback )</p></li>
<li><p>new <a href="http://github.com/wycats/merb/tree/master/merb-core/spec/public/test/view_matchers_spec.rb#L16-36">have_selector</a> spec helper using CSS3 compatible selector.</p></li>
<li><p>The entire Merb spec suite now runs correctly on JRuby &amp; Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again improved jRuby support.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In other news, we setup a nightly gem server so people who want to be on Edge don&#8217;t have to deal with git and we call also test gem releases before pushing to RubyForge. More about that coming up during RubyConf.</p>

<p>Talking about <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a>,Â  <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda</a> and <a href="http://merbist.com/about/">I</a> will be in Orlando enjoying a good Ruby meetup. Come and chat with us if you are interested in starting using Merb, or if you have been using Merb. Also, please come and see us if you hate Merb and care tell us why. We&#8217;re looking forward to meet you all.</p>
