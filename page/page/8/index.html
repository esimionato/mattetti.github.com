    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2010/01/05/amazon-kindle-2/">Amazon Kindle 2</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>For Noël, my wife got me a new toy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=merbist-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015T963C">the Amazon Kindle 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=merbist-20"><img src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/360x280_AmazonProduct/" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2>Kindle vs Nook</h2>

<p>Before my wife bought what became my new favorite gadget, we checked on the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4176062087_704a33b9fd_m.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The primary problem with the Nook was that it was out of stock. That pushed me to dig deeper and really compare both devices.</p>

<p>The Nook had some interesting features like wifi, small color screen and the book lending feature.</p>

<p>However, I don&#8217;t really care about a small, clunky extra color screen since I just want to read books. The wifi is nice&#8230; but what am I going to do with it? Lending books is a cool feature, but this feature isn&#8217;t available for all books and is apparently seriously limited.</p>

<p>So I decided to focus on what I really needed instead of what I could use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The main purpose of an e-book is reading, page loading should be fast and the user experience should be at least as good as when reading a &#8216;real&#8217; book.</p></li>
<li><p>I need to be able to have a great choice of books and if possible in multiple languages.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to be able to read the <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">safarionline</a> books that I can access online.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>From what I read almost everywhere, the nook is slow and a bit buggy (it&#8217;s a first generation after all) and doesn&#8217;t come with a web browser. I also checked on the ebooks available on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. Amazon has way more ebooks and that&#8217;s really what motivated my decision. The other thing is that Amazon is present world wide and I expect them to start selling more ebooks in French and Spanish.</p>

<p>The other thing that pushed me to buy a Kindle was the fact that I know so many people having one and being so pleased. During a recent trip to San Diego, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/yehudakatz">Yehuda Katz</a> told me about how much he loves his Kindle and he recommended a book to read. I started reading the book on my iPhone (using kindle for iPhone) and was really wanted a bigger screen.</p>

<h2>Kindle vs iTablet</h2>

<p>A lot of people asked me why I didn&#8217;t wait for the big announcement of the iTablet because it might be a Kindle killer.</p>

<p>First, the iTablet is currently just a rumor and if we would believe the rumor, the iTablet will sell around $1,000 vs $250 for a kindle. The tablet will probably do a lot of cool stuff my e-reader can&#8217;t do&#8230; but I don&#8217;t care I chose the kindle because I wanted a simple device to read book and only do that. Actually, the  kindle + iphone combo works great for me. I used to read a lot but because I have been moving so many times I started reading less because I always get rid of my books. Also, when traveling a lot, carrying your books with you is a pain. (especially now that most airlines charge you per bag)</p>

<h2>Kindle and tech books/documentation.</h2>

<p>If you want a kindle to read tech books, don&#8217;t get a 6&#8221;, get the kindle DX instead. Even though the 6&#8221; natively supports PDF files, the text is usually too small and the Kindle doesn&#8217;t support zooming (yet).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015TCML0?tag=merbist-20"><img src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/360x280_AmazonProduct/" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The DX is perfect to read PDFs because the ratio matches the print expectations. I was thinking about converting all the Cocoa docs to a kindle friendly format since the kindle supports search etc.. But the truth is that it&#8217;s not worth it. The display on a 6&#8221; screen is clunky, it just doesn&#8217;t feel right. I didn&#8217;t try any of the pragprog ebooks but something tells me they will just look better on the DX.</p>

<p>Since I wanted a kindle to read books and not browse tech documentation, I&#8217;m still really happy with 6&#8221;.</p>

<p>If you also have kindle or are planning on buying one soon, here are two books I&#8217;ve been enjoying reading:</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Here is the geekiest way I found to wish Happy New Year to my IM contacts:</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20091231-c9t2n9889rxiinux6qsfhqtxfq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<pre><code>framework 'ScriptingBridge'
app = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier("com.apple.iChat")
original_status = app.statusMessage
new_year = Time.mktime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0)

loop do
  now = Time.now
  time_left = (new_year - now).ceil
  if time_left &gt; 0
    app.statusMessage = "#{time_left} seconds left until 2010 (EST)"
  else
    app.statusMessage = "Happy New Year 2010!"
    exit
  end
  sleep(1)
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you are alone at home playing WOW,  you can also trigger iTunes to play a mp3 file with crowd noise and people shouting &#8217;<strong>Happy New Year 2010</strong>&#8217;!</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2009/12/29/fun-with-macruby/">Fun With MacRuby</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>To be ready for 2010, I&#8217;m taking some time off relaxing and spending time with my family in Florida.</p>

<p>During my free time, I&#8217;ve been reading, catching up on movies and TV shows and worked on the MacRuby book that I am writing for O&#8217;Reilly.</p>

<p>I wrote a bunch of small apps, played with various APIs and every single time I was amazed by all the goodies Apple makes available to developers. My most recent discovery is very simple but I wanted to share it with you.</p>

<p>I often type text in English, French and Spanish and I even mix the languages from time to time. SnowLeopard comes with a great spellchecker that auto detects the language I&#8217;m typing in and is most of the time correct. It&#8217;s a very impressive feature and I was wondering if, as a MacRuby developer, I could use one of Apple&#8217;s lib to detect what language is being used.  I dug through the documentation but didn&#8217;t find anything. I started looking at some header files and found the API to use :)</p>

<pre><code>framework 'Foundation'
class String
  def language
    CFStringTokenizerCopyBestStringLanguage(self, CFRangeMake(0, self.size))
  end
end

puts "Bonne année!".language
# =&gt; "fr"
puts "Happy new year!".language
# =&gt; "en"
puts "¡Feliz año nuevo!".language
# =&gt; "es"
puts "Felice anno nuovo!".language
# =&gt; "it"
puts "أعياد سعيدة".language
# =&gt; "ar"
puts "明けましておめでとうございます。".language
# =&gt; "ja"
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation says that the result is not guaranteed to be accurate and that typically 200-400 characters are required to reliably guess the language of a string. (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFStringTokenizerRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CFStringTokenizerCopyBestStringLanguage">CFStringTokenizer Doc</a>)</p>

<p>Probably not the most useful piece of code, but really cool none the less :)</p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

    <h1 class="title entry-title"><a href="/Matt-Aimonetti/posts/2009/11/30/lots-of-rubies-now-what/">Lots of Rubies, Now What?</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>If you were at RubyConf 2009 or looked at the schedule, you saw that the big thing happening in the Ruby scene is the maturation of a many of the Ruby implementations:
BlueRuby, HotRuby, IronRuby, JRuby, MacRuby, Maglev, MRI, REE, Rubinius, SmallRuby&#8230;
Ruby developers really have plenty of choice when it comes to choosing an alternative Ruby implementation.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing?</p>

<p>Turns out, Matz , Ruby author mentioned one ore time during RubyConf that it was actually a good thing for the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>But maybe we should take a step back and look at the big picture. So here are some of my thoughts on the topic. <em>(disclaimer: being part of the MacRuby team, I&#8217;m certainly biased)</em></p>

<p><strong>Stop comparing alternative Ruby implementations against Ruby 1.8.x.</strong></p>

<p>Even though a lot of people are still using Ruby 1.8.x, it&#8217;s totally unfair to compare against such an old version of Matz&#8217;s Ruby.
Ruby 1.9 is what people should compare against and believe me, Ruby 1.9.2 is going to change the game (much faster, cleaned up version).
Hopefully, all the Ruby alternative implementations will quickly become 1.9 compatible.</p>

<p>(On a site note, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/11/30/ruby-on-rails-2-3-5-released">Rails 2.3.5 was released</a> a few days ago which fixes some of the last few remaining Ruby 1.9 bugs)</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t trust the benchmarks</strong></p>

<p>As we all know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics">there are lies, damn lies and statistics</a>. Evan Phoenix explained that very clearly with lots of examples during his <a href="http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/">RubyConf talk</a> and I totally agree with him.
Micro benchmarks only help implementers know where they are standing and find performance issue.
Let&#8217;s take a very simple example: <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>.
What you might not know is that most JRuby benchmarks are usually &#8216;warmed up&#8217;.  Basically, to get the results you see in most reported benchmarks, you need to run the benchmark in a loop X amount of times and then run the benchmark. The reason for that is that JRuby uses HotSpot which needs to process the code to optimize the JITting and finally get your code to run faster.
The problem is that it is not a fair comparison. I was benchmarking Rails3 for instance and JRuby starts way slower than Ruby 1.8.6 and takes a little while to get as fast/faster than 1.9.1.
This is something you need to take in consideration since each deployment will slow down your app and you probably shouldn&#8217;t use JRuby if you are not using long running processes.
Another example would be MacRuby, even though the MacRuby project never released any benchmarks, it&#8217;s known to be a <em>fast</em> implementation.
Currently, the allocation of objects in MacRuby is actually still a bit costly and if you benchmark that, you can <em>show</em> that MacRuby is slow. Other operations are super optimized and both Rubinius and MacRuby will be way faster than anyone else. (check Phoenix&#8217;s talk at Ruby conf for more examples)
So, before choosing an implementation for performance reasons, benchmark against the code you are going to use.</p>

<p><strong>There is only one real original Ruby</strong></p>

<p>I think nobody will disagree with the fact that there is only one Ruby reference and that&#8217;s Matz.
Therefore is only one &#8220;real&#8221; Ruby and that is Matz&#8217;s. (Matz actually disagreed with me when I said that, since all the other implementations are also &#8220;real&#8221; but you get the point)
There is nothing wrong with Ruby&#8217;s alternatives but they stay alternatives to the original
MRI might not be the best option for every single case out there but it is and will stay the reference.</p>

<p>During RubyConf, I was joking with Matz and Koichi that maybe they should claim a Ruby tax to the Ruby implementations.
The reality is that Ruby is maintained by 5 to 10 contributors, most of them doing that on the side of their full time job.
Most of the other implementations have full time staff working hard on their implementations. That&#8217;s exciting but sad at the same time.</p>

<p>During the different talks given by the Ruby core team, it was clear that they really want to bridge the West/East gap and asked for help. It&#8217;s very honorable on their part and I hope we will see more contributions coming from outside Japan.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that even if people work hard to write the best Ruby implementation ever, let&#8217;s not forget to respect Matz&#8217;s project, team and achievements. People spent hours/weeks/months creating the Ruby language we love and even though there are some aspects that could be and are being improved, let&#8217;s not forget that when criticizing/comparing their work.</p>

<p><strong>There is not only one way to do things</strong></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where that&#8217;s coming from, but some people in our community seem to believe that there is only one way to do things and if you don&#8217;t do it their way, you do it wrong.
I personally have a hard time believing that and I even think it goes against what Ruby was designed for. (However, I must admit that sometimes I did/do think that some approaches were totally wrong :p)
It reminds me of people trying to convince you that God exists, other people trying to convince you that their religion is the only true one, or finally the other people trying to convince believers that they are wrong.
Maybe it is just that as humans we have a hard time dealing with people coming to a different conclusion than us and therefore we have to convince them that we are right and they are wrong.</p>

<p>The way I see it, for any new Ruby project, you should start be using with Ruby1.9. If it doesn&#8217;t fit your needs, then, consider an alternative. Here is how I look at the other alternatives (feel free to disagree):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/display/Research/BlueRuby">BlueRuby</a> - use if you are writing a SAP app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://hotruby.yukoba.jp/">HotRuby</a> - use if you want to use Ruby to write a Flash app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a> - use it if you want to integrate with .NET and/or write a silverlight app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> - use if you want to integrate with the Java world</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> - use it if you want to integrate with Cocoa/want a native OSX application</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com/">Maglev</a> - use if you want to use an object persistence layer and a distributed shared cache</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">REE</a> - use if you have a ruby 1.8 web app that uses too much memory</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> - use if you want to know what&#8217;s going on in your code</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://smalltalk.felk.cvut.cz/projects/smallruby">SmallRuby</a> - don&#8217;t use it yet, but keep an eye on it</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is the way I see the various existing implementations and I think this is where they shine and why they were created in the first place. They are all complimentary and help bring the Ruby language further. The goal is always the same.</p>

<p><strong>The future is exciting</strong></p>

<p>Ruby is getting everywhere or almost. Matz&#8217;s Ruby is going to get multiVM support, various other improvements and get even faster and faster.
Alternative implementations are getting more and more mature and they grow the community by bringing people from different communities (.NET, java, obj-c/cocoa)</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we are all beneficiaries of the work done by all the implementers, thank you guys and keep up the good work!</p>

<p>My recent &#8217;<a href="http://merbist.com/2009/11/09/the-ruby-revolution-is-over">Ruby revolution being over</a>&#8217; blog post generated quite a <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/11/09/the-ruby-revolution-is-over/#comments">lot of comments</a>.
Let&#8217;s be honest, I did not expect less from the readers.</p>

<p>However, I noticed three types of reactions I would like to address:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It was not a Ruby revolution, it was a Rails revolution</p></li>
<li><p>The revolution has stalled due to no major enterprise backing</p></li>
<li><p>The revolution will only be over when we will reach a greater adoption</p></li>
</ul>


<p>First of all, as <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/11/09/the-ruby-revolution-is-over/#comment-817">Joe correctly mentioned</a>, for me, the revolution is not about specifics or individuals. It&#8217;s really about the big picture.</p>

<p>The influence Ruby had and still has on the IT world seems to be undermined by some.
Ruby is a dynamic, truly Object Oriented programming scripting language <strong>designed for humans first</strong>.
The real paradigm shift is in the fact that Ruby was designed to make programming fast, enjoyable and easy instead of being optimized for the machines running it.
This is for me the essence of the revolution and it is meant to transcend the scope of the Ruby language.</p>

<p>The way I see it, Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) is more of an artist than a technician. He had a vision for software development. <strong>Programming languages cannot be optimized/designed for both machines and humans, the language designer has to choose which one he wants to privilege.</strong></p>

<p>Most programming languages believe that it&#8217;s up to the programmer to make an extra effort since he is smarter and easier to optimize than a machine. Matz questioned this approached and decided to turn things around. The result is one of the reasons why developers seem to just fall in love with Ruby.</p>

<h3>It was not a Ruby revolution, it was a Rails revolution.</h3>

<p>I am not denying that there <strong><em>also</em></strong> was a Rails revolution.
But if you look at it, Rails and its revolution are a direct effect from Ruby&#8217;s revolution.
One might argue that it is actually an extension of Ruby&#8217;s philosophy. But what is Rails if not a web framework designed to make web development fast, easy and enjoyable?
Without Ruby there would not have been Rails and that was my point, the underlying revolution comes from the language itself.</p>

<h3>The revolution has stalled due to no major enterprise backing.</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s an interesting comment. It is true that .NET and Java are still dominating the enterprise world. But let&#8217;s be clear, Ruby was not designed to please &#8220;suit people&#8221;.
And to this day, there is still a strong feeling, from some individuals against the enterprise.
In the past, DHH openly said that he did not care nor wanted to hear about the enterprise, more recently, Obie Fernandez, during one of his talks said: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2733212">&#8220;Fuck the enterprise&#8221;</a> (49:39).
<strong>But the truth is that Ruby and the so called enterprise, both, are changing.</strong>
The smart people in the enterprise world saw potential in Ruby and decided to give it a chance. An easy way to include Ruby&#8217;s philosophy without breaking the fragile enterprise equilibrium was to inject Ruby in the midst of well known and respected technologies such as Java and .NET. The enterprise can now use &#8220;re-branded Ruby versions&#8221; with &#8220;new taste or &#8216;improved&#8217; flavor&#8221; like JRuby, Scala, groovy, IronRuby.
I work for some enterprise clients and I can tell you that they &#8216;also&#8217; use Ruby. Mainly because developers love the language.
Microsoft, Apple and SAP investing in their own implementation of the language is yet another example that the enterprise recognizes the value of Matz&#8217;s work.
Nobody can blame them to try to make Ruby fit more their requirements.
So, at the end of the day, Ruby is not the #1 enterprise language and Rails isn&#8217;t used by the large majority of enterprise web apps, but that is NOT the point. Ruby has influenced the enterprise and we will see its effects for many years.</p>

<h3>The revolution will only be over when we will reach a greater adoption</h3>

<p>Saying that is missing the point entirely. A revolution is a step towards a situation change. Things don&#8217;t change right away after a revolution. It takes a long time for mentalities to evolve and for people to change their habits.
The consequences of a revolution are to be studied over the decades following the event. Take smalltalk for instance. Smalltalk adoption was not that great, however it brought a paradigm shift that directly influenced languages such as Ruby, Python and Objective-C.
So, again, do not focus on the adoption but instead look at the influence of the Ruby revolution and the ripple effect around it.</p>
